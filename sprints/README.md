# Sprint Working Directory

This directory contains active sprint work. Files here are temporary and will be archived at sprint completion.

## Structure

- `/current/` - Active sprint work in progress
- `/planning/` - Sprint planning documents
- `/templates/` - Reusable sprint templates

## Important

- Working files go in `/current/` during the sprint
- At sprint end, files move to `/docs/archives/sprint-N/`
- Only templates and planning docs persist here

See `/docs/FILE-ORGANIZATION-GUIDE.md` for complete file organization rules.
