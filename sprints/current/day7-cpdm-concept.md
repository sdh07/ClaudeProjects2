# CPDM: Claude Projects Development Method
## Sprint 5, Day 7: End-to-End Development Methodology with Quality Gates

### Executive Summary
CPDM is a comprehensive development methodology that leverages our complete traceability chain from vision to deployment, with enforced quality gates at each phase transition. It integrates all our architectural agents into a cohesive workflow.

---

## 1. CPDM Overview

### Core Principle
**"Every line of code traces back to the vision, every decision is documented, every phase has quality gates."**

### Documentation Location
The CPDM methodology will be permanently documented at:
- **Primary**: `/docs/methodologies/CPDM/` - Complete methodology reference
- **Quick Reference**: `/docs/methodologies/CPDM-Quick-Reference.md`
- **Integration**: Links from `/docs/Architecture Centric Methodology.md`
- **Templates**: `/docs/methodologies/CPDM/templates/` - Phase templates and checklists

## 5. Workflow Patterns

### Standard Feature Flow

```yaml
standard_flow:
  duration: 5-10 days
  pattern:
    day_1: Vision phase
    day_2-3: Design phase
    day_4: Decision phase
    day_5-7: Implementation phase
    day_8: Quality phase
    day_9: Delivery phase
    day_10: Feedback phase
    
  parallelization:
    - Design can start before Vision fully complete
    - Decision can overlap with Design refinement
    - Quality can begin during Implementation
```

### Fast Track (Bug Fixes)

```yaml
fast_track:
  duration: 1-2 days
  pattern:
    - Skip Vision phase (pre-approved)
    - Minimal Design phase
    - Quick Decision (standard patterns)
    - Implementation
    - Quality (focused testing)
    - Delivery
    
  quality_gates: "Reduced but not eliminated"
```

### Experimental Flow

```yaml
experimental:
  duration: Variable
  pattern:
    - Vision phase (hypothesis)
    - Design phase (prototype)
    - Decision phase (temporary)
    - Implementation (spike)
    - Quality (basic validation)
    - Delivery (limited/beta)
    - Feedback (extensive)
    
  quality_gates: "Relaxed for learning"
```
