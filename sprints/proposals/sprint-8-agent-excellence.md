# Sprint 8 Proposal: Agent Excellence

## Status: PROPOSED (Pending Sprint 7 Completion)

## Vision (From PM)
Agents should be designed and updated regularly according to:
- User feedback and real A/B tests
- Method fit (right agent for right task)
- Latest insights for Claude Code Sub Agents
- Latest insights from context/prompt engineering for frontier LLMs
- Using the latest and appropriate MCP tools

## Problems to Solve
- **Ineffective agents**: Producing wrong results (hallucination)
- **Inefficient agents**: Consuming too many tokens or producing suboptimal results

## Proposed Features

### Feature 1: Regular Agent Engineering Lab
**What**: Weekly process to systematically improve agents
**Why**: Ensures agents stay current with best practices
**Deliverables**:
- Lab process documentation
- A/B testing framework
- Performance benchmarks

### Feature 2: Agent Quality Metrics
**What**: Automated quality monitoring and reporting
**Why**: Identify ineffective agents before users encounter issues
**Deliverables**:
- Effectiveness metrics (100% target)
- Efficiency metrics (95% target)
- Token consumption tracking
- Hallucination detection

### Feature 3: Agent Self-Improvement
**What**: Agents that learn from their interactions
**Why**: Continuous improvement without manual intervention
**Deliverables**:
- Learning mechanisms
- Pattern recognition
- Automatic prompt refinement

### Feature 4: Context Engineering Standards
**What**: Best practices for prompt and context engineering
**Why**: Leverage frontier LLM capabilities effectively
**Deliverables**:
- Prompt templates
- Context optimization guide
- Agent design patterns

### Feature 5: MCP Tool Optimization
**What**: Ensure agents use the most appropriate MCP tools
**Why**: Maximize effectiveness and efficiency
**Deliverables**:
- Tool selection guide
- Performance comparisons
- Integration patterns

## Success Criteria
- 100% agent effectiveness (no hallucinations)
- 95% agent efficiency (optimal tokens)
- Measurable improvements via A/B testing
- Quality improvements prioritized over token savings

## Dependencies
- Sprint 7 CPDM v2 must be complete
- pm-guide-agent operational
- Quality gates automated

## Estimated Duration
5 days (1 sprint)

## Notes
This proposal will be refined based on:
- Sprint 7 outcomes
- CPDM v2 effectiveness
- Additional PM input
