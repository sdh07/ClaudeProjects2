# Sprint 4 Planning - Development Perfection

**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Sprint**: 4
**Duration**: 5 days (being realistic after Sprint 3!)
**Theme**: Show the Team in Action

## Sprint Goal
**"Development Perfection with Live Demo"**
- Create a real development project in user's workspace
- Show all agents working together as a team
- Demonstrate complete development workflow
- Make the invisible visible

## User Stories

### Story 1: Create Real Project
**As a** user  
**I want to** see ClaudeProjects2 create a real project in my workspace  
**So that** I can believe it actually works

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] New project created in user's workspace
- [ ] All project structure set up
- [ ] Agents coordinate the setup
- [ ] User can see each step

### Story 2: Live Agent Team Demo
**As a** user  
**I want to** see all agents working together  
**So that** I understand how the team collaborates

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Show message flow between agents
- [ ] Display agent decisions in real-time
- [ ] Demonstrate agent specialization
- [ ] Make coordination visible

### Story 3: Full Development Workflow
**As a** user  
**I want to** see a complete feature developed  
**So that** I understand the end-to-end process

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Plan → Code → Test → Review → Deploy
- [ ] All agents participate
- [ ] Real code gets written
- [ ] Real tests pass
- [ ] Real PR created

## Technical Tasks

### Day 1: Project Setup Demo
- [ ] Create new project via agents
- [ ] Set up development environment
- [ ] Initialize git repository
- [ ] Create initial structure

### Day 2: Feature Development Demo
- [ ] Plan a simple feature
- [ ] Write actual code
- [ ] Create tests
- [ ] Show agents collaborating

### Day 3: Quality & Review Demo
- [ ] Run code review
- [ ] Execute tests
- [ ] Build project
- [ ] Show quality gates

### Day 4: Deployment Demo
- [ ] Create PR
- [ ] Show approval workflow
- [ ] Deploy to environment
- [ ] Celebrate success

### Day 5: Polish & Documentation
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Record demo video
- [ ] Prepare handoff
- [ ] Plan next steps

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Create a Todo App"
Simple but shows everything:
1. User: "Create a todo app in my workspace"
2. orchestrator → project-agent: Set up project
3. project-agent → Creates structure
4. methodology-agent → Plans features
5. version-agent → Initializes git
6. All agents → Collaborate on implementation

### Scenario 2: "Add Authentication"
Shows feature addition:
1. User: "Add user authentication"
2. Agents collaborate to:
   - Design the feature
   - Implement code
   - Write tests
   - Review code
   - Deploy changes

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Real project running in user workspace
- [ ] User sees agents working together
- [ ] Complete workflow demonstrated
- [ ] "I believe it now!" moment achieved

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Too abstract
  - **Mitigation**: Show real files, real code, real results
- **Risk**: Too fast to follow
  - **Mitigation**: Add pauses, explanations, visualizations
- **Risk**: Errors during demo
  - **Mitigation**: Have backup plan, show error handling

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Working project in user workspace
- [ ] All agents demonstrated
- [ ] User can replicate the process
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] "Wow" factor achieved

## Team Commitment
We commit to showing, not telling. Every action will be visible, every decision explained, every agent's contribution clear.

**Let's show the world what AI-augmented development really looks like!**
