# Sprint 7: Agent Excellence

## Vision (From PM)

### What is Agent Excellence?
Agents should be designed and updated regularly according to:
- User feedback and real A/B tests
- Method fit (right agent for right task)
- Latest insights for Claude Code Sub Agents
- Latest insights from context/prompt engineering for frontier LLMs
- Using the latest and appropriate MCP tools

### Problems to Solve
- **Ineffective agents**: Producing wrong results (hallucination)
- **Inefficient agents**: Consuming too many tokens or producing suboptimal results due to poor prompt engineering

### Value Delivery
- Effective and efficient agents
- Measurable quality improvements
- Reduced token consumption
- Better user experience

### Success Criteria
- 100% effective agents (no hallucinations)
- 95% efficient agents (optimal token usage)
- Improvements measured by A/B testing on:
  - Quality of results (primary)
  - Consumed tokens (secondary)

## Proposed Features

### Feature 1: Regular Agent Engineering Lab
**What**: Weekly process to systematically improve agents
**Why**: Ensures agents stay current with best practices and user needs
**Capabilities**:
- Performance metric reviews
- A/B testing framework
- Prompt engineering updates
- MCP tool optimization
- Feedback integration

### Feature 2: Agent Quality Framework
**What**: Automated quality metrics and monitoring
**Why**: Identify and fix ineffective agents before users encounter issues
**Capabilities**:
- Hallucination detection
- Token efficiency tracking
- Success rate monitoring
- Performance benchmarking

### Feature 3: Agent Self-Improvement
**What**: Agents that learn and improve from their interactions
**Why**: Continuous improvement without manual intervention
**Capabilities**:
- Performance self-assessment
- Automatic prompt refinement
- Knowledge base updates
- Pattern learning

### Feature 4: PM Guide Agent
**What**: Sub-agent that guides PM through CPDM process
**Why**: Address confusion about process flow and next steps
**Capabilities**:
- Process navigation
- Template provision
- Context awareness
- Decision tracking

### Feature 5: Sprint Cleanup Agent
**What**: Automatic management of sprint artifacts
**Why**: Keep working directories clean and organized
**Capabilities**:
- Archive completed sprints
- Organize current work
- Generate summaries
- Maintain structure

## Sprint 7 Schedule

### Day 1: Foundation
- Set up Agent Engineering Lab process
- Create pm-guide-agent
- Design quality metrics framework

### Day 2: Quality Framework
- Implement agent effectiveness metrics
- Create hallucination detection
- Build token tracking system

### Day 3: Self-Improvement
- Design agent learning system
- Implement feedback loops
- Create A/B testing framework

### Day 4: Process Agents
- Complete pm-guide-agent
- Implement sprint-cleanup-agent
- Test CPDM v2 flow

### Day 5: Integration & Testing
- Run first Agent Engineering Lab
- Test all new agents
- Measure improvements
- Sprint retrospective

## Key Deliverables

1. **Agent Engineering Lab Process** - Documented weekly improvement cycle
2. **Quality Metrics Dashboard** - Real-time agent performance visibility
3. **PM Guide Agent** - Interactive CPDM assistant
4. **Sprint Cleanup Agent** - Automated artifact management
5. **A/B Testing Framework** - Data-driven agent improvements
6. **Updated Agent Templates** - With self-verification and metrics

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Over-engineering the solution
**Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate based on feedback

### Risk: Breaking existing agents
**Mitigation**: A/B testing, gradual rollout, rollback capability

### Risk: Too many metrics, not enough action
**Mitigation**: Focus on actionable metrics only

## Questions for PM

1. Should the Agent Engineering Lab be daily or weekly?
2. What's the priority order for the five features?
3. Any specific agents that need immediate improvement?
4. How should we measure "agent excellence" to users?
