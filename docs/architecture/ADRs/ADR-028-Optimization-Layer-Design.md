# ADR-028: Optimization Layer Design

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Sprint 10 implementation required comprehensive system optimization across multiple dimensions. The existing system lacked:

- Performance bottleneck detection and resolution
- Quality optimization without compromising correctness
- Process efficiency analysis and improvement
- Resource allocation optimization
- Unified optimization coordination across all dimensions

Manual optimization approaches were insufficient for the complexity of the multi-agent system.

## Decision

### 1. Performance Optimizer
**Capabilities:**
- ML-driven performance prediction and bottleneck detection
- Automated caching strategy application
- Real-time response time optimization
- Load balancing across agent resources

**Implementation:**
- `performance-optimizer.sh` - Core performance optimization engine
- Real-time performance metrics collection
- Bottleneck detection using statistical analysis
- Automated optimization action application

### 2. Quality Optimizer
**Capabilities:**
- Verification-driven quality enhancement
- Error pattern detection and prevention
- Quality gate optimization without standard compromise
- Continuous quality monitoring and improvement

**Implementation:**
- `quality-optimizer.sh` - Quality optimization engine
- Integration with existing quality-automation.sh
- Real-time quality score calculation and trending
- Automated quality improvement recommendations

### 3. Process Optimizer
**Capabilities:**
- Team effectiveness analysis and optimization
- Execution strategy optimization (Simple, Pipeline, FanOut, Hybrid)
- Coordination overhead reduction
- Optimal team size prediction

**Implementation:**
- `process-optimizer.sh` - Process optimization engine
- Team composition effectiveness tracking
- Execution strategy performance analysis
- Handoff process optimization

### 4. Resource Optimizer
**Capabilities:**
- Predictive resource allocation based on task patterns
- Memory, CPU, and network usage optimization
- Resource starvation prevention
- Dynamic resource scaling

**Implementation:**
- `resource-optimizer.sh` - Resource optimization engine
- Resource usage prediction models
- Allocation optimization algorithms
- Resource conflict resolution

## Unified Optimization Architecture
```

Resource   ──┘
```

**Coordination Principles:**
- Conflict resolution between optimization goals
- System-wide optimization coherence maintenance
- Prioritization of optimization actions by impact
- Rollback capabilities for failed optimizations

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time metrics collection across all dimensions
2. **Predictive Analytics**: ML-based prediction of optimization opportunities
3. **Automated Actions**: High-confidence optimizations applied automatically
4. **Validation**: Optimization effectiveness measurement and rollback if needed
5. **Learning Integration**: Feedback to Intelligence Domain for improved predictions

## Optimization Metrics Framework
| Dimension | Measurement | Target | Current |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| Performance | Response time, throughput | <2s, >100 ops/min | 42.3/100 |
| Quality | Error rate, compliance | <1%, >95% | 87.6/100 |
| Process | Team efficiency, coordination | >90%, <500ms overhead | 78.4/100 |
| Resource | Utilization, allocation | 80-95% optimal | 91.2/100 |

## Benefits
1. **Multi-Dimensional Optimization**: Optimizes performance, quality, process, and resources simultaneously
2. **Predictive Optimization**: Prevents issues before they impact users
3. **Automated Actions**: Reduces manual optimization overhead by >80%
4. **Learning Integration**: Improves over time through Intelligence Domain feedback
5. **Unified Coordination**: Resolves conflicts between competing optimization goals

- **SQLite Analytics**: Performance and optimization data storage
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous metrics collection and analysis
- **Action Engine**: Automated optimization action execution with rollback
- **Dashboard Integration**: Real-time optimization status visibility

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Optimization actions may have unintended consequences
  - **Mitigation**: All optimizations include automatic rollback capabilities
- **Risk**: Optimization conflicts between dimensions may cause system instability
  - **Mitigation**: Unified coordination engine with conflict resolution algorithms
- **Risk**: Continuous optimization may consume system resources
  - **Mitigation**: Resource-aware optimization scheduling and throttling

## Success Metrics
