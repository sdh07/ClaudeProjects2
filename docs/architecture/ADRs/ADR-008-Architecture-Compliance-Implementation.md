# ADR-008: Architecture Compliance Implementation

**Status**: Implemented  
**Date**: 2025-01-30  
**Decision Makers**: Development Team  
**Related**: ADR-003, Physical Architecture Document

## Context

During Sprint 3 implementation, we discovered deviations from the physical architecture:
- Simplified message queue structure
- Missing Obsidian vault
- Incorrect context directory naming
- Missing runtime directories

## Decision

We implemented full architecture compliance by:
1. Restructuring message queues with priority directories
2. Creating Obsidian vault at `~/Documents/ClaudeProjects2-Vault/`
3. Migrating `state/` to `context/working/`
4. Adding runtime directories (cache, logs, temp)
5. Initializing analytics SQLite database
6. Creating proper configuration structure

## Implementation Details

### Message Queue Structure (Per ADR-003)
```
.claudeprojects/messages/
├── queues/{agent}/{priority|normal|low}/
├── processing/{agent}/
├── dead-letter/
└── archive/
```

### Context Structure (Per Physical Architecture)
```
.claudeprojects/
├── context/working/    # Active context
├── context/history/    # Context history
├── knowledge/          # Local knowledge
├── agents/            # Project agents
└── config/            # Configuration
```

### Obsidian Integration
- Vault created at standard location
- Ready for MCP integration
- Structured for all project types

## Consequences

### Positive
- Full compliance with architecture
- Better scalability for multi-project
- Priority message handling works correctly
- Analytics tracking ready
- Obsidian integration prepared

### Negative
- Migration required for existing messages
- Slightly more complex directory structure
- Scripts needed updating

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with full architecture** - Shortcuts create technical debt
2. **Architecture documents are contracts** - Follow them precisely
3. **Migration is easier early** - Fix deviations immediately

## Migration Performed

- ✅ All messages migrated to new queue structure
- ✅ State directory renamed to context/working
- ✅ Agent registry preserved
- ✅ Scripts updated for new structure

## Validation

The system now matches 100% of the physical architecture specification.
