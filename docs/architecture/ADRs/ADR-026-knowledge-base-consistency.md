# ADR-026: Knowledge Base Consistency Implementation

## Status
**Proposed** → Awaiting PM Confirmation

## Context

### Business Driver
The Knowledge Base Consistency feature aims to deliver 25x ROI through automated architecture synchronization, addressing critical issues where architectural documents diverge from implementation reality.

### Current State Analysis
- **Vision**: Approved with validated 25x ROI calculation
- **Logical Architecture**: Complete with 3 core aggregates (ArchitectureDocument, ConsistencyRule, ConflictResolution)
- **Domain Services**: Defined (ConsistencyOrchestrator, ConflictDetector, MergeStrategyService)
- **Integration Points**: 4 existing agents (vision-agent, logical-architect-agent, physical-architect-agent, knowledge-agent)

### Technical Challenge
Implementation requires sophisticated conflict detection, real-time synchronization, and intelligent merge resolution across heterogeneous document types (Markdown, YAML frontmatter, JSON configurations).

## Decision

### Architecture Pattern Selection

**Primary Decision: Specialized Agent with Event-Driven Architecture**

We will implement a new `consistency-agent` using the established agent pattern with enhanced message queue capabilities for real-time conflict detection and resolution.

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with existing agent-based architecture
- Enables autonomous operation with human oversight
- Leverages Claude's natural language processing for intelligent conflict resolution
- Maintains consistency with current system patterns

### Physical Component Mapping

#### Domain Aggregate → Agent Component Mapping

```yaml
aggregate_mapping:
  ArchitectureDocument:
    component: consistency-agent-document-manager
    location: /agents/knowledge/consistency-agent.md
    capabilities:
      - Document tracking and versioning
      - Reference integrity validation
      - Change detection and notification
    storage: /.cpdm/consistency/documents/*.json
    
  ConsistencyRule:
    component: consistency-agent-rule-engine
    location: /agents/knowledge/consistency-agent.md
    capabilities:
      - Rule definition and validation
      - Rule persistence to file system
      - Rule evaluation engine
    storage: /.cpdm/consistency/rules/*.json
    
  ConflictResolution:
    component: consistency-agent-resolver
    location: /agents/knowledge/consistency-agent.md
    capabilities:
      - Intelligent merge strategies
      - Human escalation workflows
      - Resolution history tracking
    storage: /.cpdm/consistency/resolutions/*.json
```

#### Domain Services → Implementation Strategy

```yaml
service_mapping:
  ConsistencyOrchestrator:
    implementation: Agent-based coordination
    location: /agents/knowledge/consistency-agent.md
    purpose: Master coordinator for all consistency operations
    
  ConflictDetector:
    implementation: Hybrid (Agent + Scripts)
    location: 
      - /agents/knowledge/consistency-agent.md (intelligence)
      - /scripts/conflict-detector.sh (file scanning)
    purpose: Multi-layered conflict detection
    
  MergeStrategyService:
    implementation: Agent-based reasoning
    location: /agents/knowledge/consistency-agent.md
    purpose: AI-powered intelligent resolution
```

### Technical Implementation Decisions

#### 1. File-Based Message Queue Enhancement

**Decision: Extend existing queue with priority routing and conflict events**

```yaml
message_queue_enhancements:
  conflict_events:
    location: /.cpdm/messages/conflicts/
    format: JSON with conflict metadata
    priority: HIGH (processed before standard messages)
    retention: 30 days for audit trail
    
  consistency_checks:
    location: /.cpdm/messages/consistency/
    format: JSON with check results
    priority: MEDIUM
    retention: 7 days
    
  resolution_actions:
    location: /.cpdm/messages/resolutions/
    format: JSON with merge decisions
    priority: HIGH
    retention: 90 days for compliance
```

#### 2. Conflict Detection Algorithm

**Decision: Multi-layered detection with semantic analysis**

```yaml
detection_strategy:
  layer_1_file_diff:
    tool: git diff + file timestamps
    coverage: All tracked architecture files
    performance: < 100ms for full repository scan
    
  layer_2_semantic_analysis:
    tool: Claude-powered content analysis
    coverage: Markdown content, YAML frontmatter
    performance: < 2s per document pair
    
  layer_3_cross_reference_validation:
    tool: Graph-based reference checking
    coverage: ADR links, agent references, traceability
    performance: < 5s for full dependency graph
```

#### 3. Storage Pattern

**Decision: Structured file system with SQLite index**

```yaml
storage_architecture:
  consistency_rules:
    primary: /.cpdm/consistency/rules/*.json
    index: /.cpdm/consistency/rules.db (SQLite)
    backup: Git versioning
    
  conflict_history:
    primary: /.cpdm/consistency/conflicts/*.json
    index: /.cpdm/consistency/conflicts.db (SQLite)
    retention: 1 year with automatic archival
    
  resolution_templates:
    primary: /.cpdm/consistency/templates/*.yaml
    version_control: Git tracked
    sharing: Team repository
```

#### 4. Integration Protocol

**Decision: Event-driven integration with existing agents**

```yaml
integration_points:
  vision_agent:
    trigger: Vision document changes
    message: "vision_updated" event
    action: Validate feature→vision consistency
    
  logical_architect_agent:
    trigger: Domain model changes
    message: "logical_architecture_updated" event
    action: Check object→feature traceability
    
  physical_architect_agent:
    trigger: ADR or component changes
    message: "physical_architecture_updated" event
    action: Validate object→component mapping
    
  knowledge_agent:
    trigger: Any knowledge base change
    message: "knowledge_updated" event
    action: Cross-reference validation
```

### Performance and Scalability Decisions

#### 1. Conflict Detection Performance

**Target: < 30 seconds for full repository consistency check**

```yaml
performance_strategy:
  incremental_checking:
    approach: Git hook triggers for changed files only
    expected_improvement: 90% reduction in check time
    
  parallel_processing:
    approach: Concurrent file analysis with worker threads
    expected_improvement: 70% reduction in processing time
    
  intelligent_caching:
    approach: Cache semantic analysis results with invalidation
    expected_improvement: 85% reduction in repeated analysis
```

#### 2. Scalability Architecture

**Target: Support 1000+ architecture files with sub-second conflict detection**

```yaml
scalability_design:
  horizontal_scaling:
    pattern: Multiple consistency-agent instances
    coordination: File-based locking mechanism
    
  data_partitioning:
    strategy: Domain-based file organization
    benefit: Isolated consistency checks per domain
    
  lazy_loading:
    pattern: On-demand rule evaluation
    benefit: Reduced memory footprint for large repositories
```

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

#### 1. Conflict Resolution Safety

**Risk: Automated merge causing data loss**

```yaml
mitigation_strategy:
  backup_before_resolution:
    approach: Automatic git commit before any merge
    rollback: Simple git reset capability
    
  human_approval_gates:
    trigger: High-risk conflicts (>50% content difference)
    workflow: Escalate to PM for manual review
    
  resolution_simulation:
    approach: Dry-run mode showing proposed changes
    validation: User confirmation required before application
```

#### 2. Performance Degradation

**Risk: Consistency checking slowing development workflow**

```yaml
mitigation_strategy:
  async_processing:
    approach: Non-blocking consistency checks
    user_experience: Background processing with notifications
    
  intelligent_scheduling:
    approach: Run intensive checks during low-activity periods
    optimization: Git commit hooks for immediate validation
    
  graceful_degradation:
    approach: Fallback to basic file diff if semantic analysis times out
    guarantee: Always provide some level of consistency checking
```

### New Agent Specification

#### consistency-agent

```yaml
agent_type: knowledge
primary_capability: architecture_consistency_management
location: /agents/knowledge/consistency-agent.md

core_responsibilities:
  - Monitor architecture document changes
  - Detect consistency violations across hierarchy
  - Execute automated conflict resolution

    - sends: conflict_detected, resolution_completed
    
  file_system:
    - monitors: /docs/architecture/**/*.md
    - writes: /.cpdm/consistency/**/*
    
  external_agents:
    - coordinates_with: vision-agent, logical-architect-agent, physical-architect-agent

performance_requirements:
  - response_time: <5 seconds for conflict detection
  - throughput: 100+ document comparisons per minute
