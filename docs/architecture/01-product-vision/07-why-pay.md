## Pricing: Pay for What Matters

### For Consultancies

| Plan             | Price    | Core Value                                      | Real Difference                                           |
| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Starter**      | $200/mo  | Test the waters                                 | Basic agents, proven methodologies                        |
| **Professional** | $500/mo  | **Agent Builder Pro**<br>Create custom agents   | Design agents that handle YOUR specific client situations |
| **Agency**       | $2000/mo | **Full Arsenal**<br>Everything + co-development | We help you build proprietary methodologies               |
|                  |          |                                                 |                                                           |

### For Enterprises

| Plan | Price | Core Value | Real Difference |
|------|-------|------------|-----------------|
| **Team** | $500/mo | Innovation projects | Guided methodology execution |
| **Business** | $2000/mo | **Transformation**<br>Custom agent teams | Your own AI innovation department |

**What separates tiers**: Not features, but depth of expertise access and agent creation capabilities.

## Why Not Just Use ChatGPT + Notion?

| Challenge | ChatGPT + Notion | ClaudeProjects |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Methodology Execution** | Read PDF, copy-paste | One-click executable |
| **Context Persistence** | Lost between sessions | Full project memory |
| **Team Coordination** | Manual sharing | AI-orchestrated |
| **Quality Consistency** | Varies by prompt | Guaranteed excellence |
| **Time to Results** | Hours of setup | < 1 hour to value |

**Bottom line**: Generic tools = generic results. ClaudeProjects = 10x outcomes.

## "But It's Open Source - Why Pay?"

**Let's be honest**: In a Claude Code world, anyone can build anything. So what are you really paying for?

### 1. Deep Methodology Expertise
We've spent years perfecting innovation methodologies. You're buying:
- **Which** methodology works for **which** situation
- Pre-configured agent teams that actually deliver results
- Proven workflow patterns from 1000s of projects
- The difference between "it works" and "it's excellent"

### 2. Advanced Agent Creation
Yes, you can prompt Claude Code to build agents. But can you:
- Design agents that handle edge cases in innovation workshops?
- Create multi-agent orchestrations that don't conflict?
- Build agents that learn from each project and improve?
- **This is our secret sauce** - and yes, our most advanced agent creation tools are paid-only

### 3. Time & Opportunity Cost
- You could spend 2 weeks building your own innovation platform
- Or start delivering client projects tomorrow
- At $10K per project, that's $40K opportunity cost
- Plus, while you're building, we're already improving

### 4. The Network Effect
- Methodologies proven across industries
- Agent improvements from all users
- Partner ecosystem for delivery
- You join a system that gets smarter daily

**The Honest Truth**: 
> "Could our CTO build this? Probably. Would it be as good? No. Would it take 6 months? Yes. Would we maintain it? Hell no." - Innovation Director, Munich

## Common Objections (Handled)

**"It's too expensive"**
‚Üí ROI in first week. Bernhard saves 116 hours/month. At $100/hour, that's $11,600 saved for $500 cost.

**"We already have PM tools"**
‚Üí PM tools track work. We DO work. Completely different category.

**"What about our data?"**
‚Üí Local-first architecture. Your data, your control. Cloud optional.

**"Will AI replace us?"**
‚Üí AI amplifies you. You become 10x more valuable, not replaced.

## Success Guarantee

‚úÖ **30-day money back** - No questions asked
‚úÖ **10x productivity promise** - Measured and proven
‚úÖ **White-glove onboarding** - Success from day one
