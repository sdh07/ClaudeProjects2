**Desired Outcomes:**
- Natural language task descriptions "just work"
- Automatic optimal agent selection
- Seamless context preservation
- Graceful error recovery
- Performance insights and optimization

### 2. Business Goals (Why Business Cares)

**Strategic Objectives:**
- **Scalability**: Support 100+ agents without complexity explosion
- **Efficiency**: Reduce task completion time by 40%
- **Quality**: Increase first-time success rate to 95%
- **Innovation**: Enable rapid agent ecosystem growth
- **Differentiation**: Industry-leading intelligent orchestration

**Success Metrics:**
- Agent utilization rate > 80%
- Context consistency: 100%
- Task success rate > 95%
- User satisfaction > 4.5/5
- Development velocity increase: 3x

### 3. Technical Feasibility (Why It's Possible)

**Proven Patterns:**
- Blueprint validation from claude-code-sub-agents
- Existing agent infrastructure to build upon
- Message queue system already operational
- Performance tracking script exists
- Clear architectural boundaries

**Key Enablers:**
- Agent-based architecture foundation
