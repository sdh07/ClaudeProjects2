## Bernhard's Sustainable Innovation Pitch

### The Challenge

Bernhard, an innovation consultant specializing in sustainable transformation, wants to pitch his services to ACME Corp, a manufacturing company. Instead of generic slides, he needs to arrive with tailored innovation concepts that merge their business objectives with sustainability trends.

### Without ClaudeProjects (3 weeks)

- Week 1: Researching ACME's annual reports, sustainability commitments, competitor analysis
- Week 2: Tracking sustainability trends, regulatory changes, market innovations
- Week 3: Manually connecting dots, creating concepts, building pitch deck

Total: 120+ hours, generic ideas, missed connections between trends and objectives

### With ClaudeProjects (4 hours)
