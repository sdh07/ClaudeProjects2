# ClaudeProjects2 Architecture Documentation

> Clean, agent-based architecture for 10x productivity through AI-augmented knowledge work

## Architecture Overview

ClaudeProjects2 implements a **pure agent-based architecture** where:
- Everything is a Claude Code agent (no traditional services)
- CLAUDE.md serves as living orchestration
- File-based message queues enable agent communication
- Local-first design with optional cloud sync
- Obsidian provides the knowledge management UI

## Documentation Structure

### ðŸ“— [02 - Logical Architecture](02-logical-architecture/)
**WHAT** the system does conceptually
- Domain model and layered architecture
- Cross-cutting concerns (10x engine, context management)
- Quality attributes and data flows

### ðŸ“™ [03 - Physical Architecture](03-physical-architecture/)
**HOW** the system is built with agents
- Agent-based architecture design
- Communication protocols and performance
- Deployment specifications and integrations

### ðŸ“• [Architecture Decision Records](ADRs/)

**For Architects**: Review [ADRs](ADRs/) for key decisions

## Key Architectural Principles

1. **Agent-First**: Every component has intelligence
2. **Local-First**: Full functionality offline, privacy by default
3. **File-Based**: Simple, debuggable, portable
4. **Self-Improving**: Agents learn and evolve
5. **10x Productivity**: Every decision enables order-of-magnitude gains

## Living Architecture

This architecture evolves as:
- Agents improve themselves
- New patterns emerge
- User needs change
- Technology advances
