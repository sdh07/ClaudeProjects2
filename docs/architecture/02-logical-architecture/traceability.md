# Logical Architecture Traceability

> **Purpose**: Ensure complete traceability from features through layers and domains to objects, with clear ownership and boundaries.

## Overview

This document defines how the logical architecture maintains traceability with:
- **Clear layer-domain ownership**
- **Complete domain object models**
- **Moderate boundary enforcement**
- **Feature routing decision trees**

## Layer-Domain Ownership Model

### Ownership Matrix

| Layer | Owns Domains | Can Reference | Responsibilities |
|-------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Presentation** | â€¢ user_interface_domain | â€¢ user_domain<br>â€¢ project_domain | UI components, interactions, visual feedback |
| **Application** | â€¢ workflow_domain<br>â€¢ orchestration_domain | â€¢ all domains (coordination) | Use case orchestration, workflows, cross-domain coordination |
| **Domain** | â€¢ project_domain<br>â€¢ methodology_domain<br>â€¢ agent_domain<br>â€¢ knowledge_domain<br>â€¢ user_domain<br>â€¢ value_analytics_domain<br>â€¢ marketplace_domain | â€¢ other domains in same layer | Business logic, domain rules, entity management |
| **Infrastructure** | â€¢ persistence_domain<br>â€¢ messaging_domain<br>â€¢ integration_domain | â€¢ none (provides services) | Technical services, external integrations, data persistence |

### Boundary Rules (Moderate Enforcement)

```yaml
enforcement_rules:
  allowed:
    - Direct calls within same layer
    - Shared value objects between domains
    - Domain services for complex operations
    
  forbidden:
    - Cross-layer direct access (must use interfaces)
    - Circular dependencies between domains
    - Infrastructure accessing domain logic
    
  requires_interface:
    - Presentation â†’ Domain communication
    - Application â†’ Infrastructure communication
    - External system integration
```

## Feature Routing Process

### Step 1: Identify Primary Layer

```mermaid
graph TD
    F[New Feature] --> Q{Primary Concern?}
    Q -->|Display/UX| L1[Presentation Layer]
    Q -->|Workflow| L2[Application Layer]
    Q -->|Business Logic| L3[Domain Layer]
    Q -->|Technical| L4[Infrastructure Layer]
```

### Step 2: Assign to Domain(s)

| If Primary Layer is... | Consider these Domains |
|------------------------|------------------------|
| Presentation | user_interface_domain |
| Application | workflow_domain, orchestration_domain |
| Domain | project, methodology, agent, knowledge, user, analytics, marketplace |
| Infrastructure | persistence, messaging, integration |

### Step 3: Identify Objects

For each domain involved, identify:
- **Aggregates**: Root entities with boundaries
- **Entities**: Objects with identity
- **Value Objects**: Immutable descriptors
- **Domain Services**: Complex operations

## Domain Object Models

### Complete Models Available

| Domain | Model Status | Location |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Knowledge Domain | âœ… Complete | `/domain-models/knowledge-domain-model.yaml` |
| Project Domain | ðŸ”„ In Progress | `/domain-models/project-domain-model.yaml` |
| Methodology Domain | ðŸ“‹ Planned | `/domain-models/methodology-domain-model.yaml` |
| Agent Domain | ðŸ“‹ Planned | `/domain-models/agent-domain-model.yaml` |
| User Domain | ðŸ“‹ Planned | `/domain-models/user-domain-model.yaml` |
| Value Analytics | ðŸ“‹ Planned | `/domain-models/analytics-domain-model.yaml` |
| Marketplace | ðŸ“‹ Planned | `/domain-models/marketplace-domain-model.yaml` |

### Object Patterns

#### Aggregate Pattern
```yaml
aggregate:
  name: [Aggregate Name]
  root: [Root Entity]
  contains: [Entities and Value Objects]
  invariants: [Business rules that must hold]
  boundary: "All access through root"
```

#### Entity Pattern
```yaml
entity:
  name: [Entity Name]
  identity: [How identified]
  lifecycle: [created â†’ active â†’ deleted]
  relationships: [Links to other entities]
```

#### Value Object Pattern
```yaml
value_object:
  name: [Value Object Name]
  immutable: true
  attributes: [Properties]
  equality: "By value comparison"
```

## Feature Traceability Examples

### Example 1: Obsidian-Like Editor

```yaml
feature: Obsidian-Like Editor
trace:
  vision: Living Knowledge Systems
  layers:
    presentation: 40% (Editor UI)
    application: 20% (Save workflows)
    domain: 30% (Document model)
    infrastructure: 10% (File storage)
  domains:
    primary: knowledge_domain
    supporting: [user_domain, agent_domain]
  objects:
    new:
      - EditorComponent (Presentation)
      - EditingWorkflow (Application)
      - MarkdownContent (Domain)
    modified:
      - Document (Domain)
      - LinkResolutionService (Domain)
    infrastructure:
      - FileStore (Infrastructure)
      - SearchIndex (Infrastructure)
```

### Example 2: AI Code Review

```yaml
feature: AI Code Review
trace:
  vision: 10x Productivity
  layers:
    presentation: 10% (Review UI)
    application: 25% (Review workflow)
    domain: 60% (Review logic)
    infrastructure: 5% (Git integration)
  domains:
    primary: agent_domain
    supporting: [project_domain, knowledge_domain]
  objects:
    new:
      - CodeReviewAgent (Domain)
      - ReviewResult (Domain)
      - ReviewWorkflow (Application)
    modified:
      - Agent (Domain)
      - Project (Domain)
```
