# Logical Architecture

> **What** the system does - capabilities, domains, and business logic

## Quick Start

The logical architecture implements the **Triple Helix** innovation:
- **Methodology** guides every workflow
- **AI Agents** execute with expertise  
- **Knowledge** learns and improves continuously
