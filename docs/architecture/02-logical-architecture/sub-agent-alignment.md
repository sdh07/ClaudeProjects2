## Domain Model

### Core Entities

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Task {
        +id: String
        +description: String
        +requirements: Requirements
        +priority: Priority
        +status: Status
    }
    
    class Agent {
        +id: String
        +name: String
        +capabilities: Capability[]
        +performance: Performance
        +status: AgentStatus
    }
    
    class Context {
        +id: String
        +taskId: String
        +state: Map
        +history: Event[]
        +parent: Context
    }
    
    class Team {
        +id: String
        +agents: Agent[]
        +coordinator: Agent
        +strategy: Strategy
    }
    
    class Execution {
        +id: String
        +task: Task
        +team: Team
        +context: Context
        +result: Result
    }
    
    class Pattern {
        +id: String
        +condition: Condition
        +composition: Team
        +successRate: Float
    }
    
    Task --> Team : assigned to
    Team --> Agent : contains
    Execution --> Task : executes
    Execution --> Context : uses
    Pattern --> Team : recommends
```

### Key Relationships

1. **Task → Team**: Tasks are assigned to dynamically composed teams
2. **Team → Agent**: Teams consist of one or more agents with defined roles
3. **Context → Execution**: Context flows through execution chain
4. **Pattern → Learning**: Patterns inform future team composition
5. **Agent → Capability**: Agents advertise their capabilities

## Behavioral Model

### Task Execution Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Orchestrator
    participant Analyzer
    participant Composer
    participant Team
    participant Context
    participant Learning
    
    User->>Orchestrator: Submit Task
    Orchestrator->>Analyzer: Analyze Requirements
    Analyzer->>Composer: Requirements + Capabilities
    Composer->>Team: Compose Optimal Team
    Team->>Context: Initialize Context
    
    loop For Each Agent in Team
        Team->>Agent: Execute with Context
        Agent->>Context: Update State
        Agent->>Team: Return Result
    end
    
    Team->>Orchestrator: Aggregate Results
    Orchestrator->>Learning: Record Execution
    Learning->>Learning: Update Patterns
    Orchestrator->>User: Return Results
```

### Error Recovery Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Executing
    Executing --> Success : Task Complete
    Executing --> Failure : Error Detected
    
    Failure --> Retry : Retryable Error
    Retry --> Executing : Attempt Again
    Retry --> Fallback : Max Retries
    
    Failure --> Fallback : Non-Retryable
    Fallback --> AlternateAgent : Agent Available
    Fallback --> Decompose : Complex Task
    Fallback --> Manual : No Alternative
    
    AlternateAgent --> Executing : Try Alternative
    Decompose --> Executing : Subtasks
    Manual --> [*] : User Intervention
    Success --> [*] : Complete
