## Aggregate Boundaries

### Task Aggregate
- Root: Task
- Includes: Subtasks, Requirements
- Invariants: Status consistency, requirement validation

### Agent Aggregate
- Root: Agent
- Includes: Capabilities, Performance
- Invariants: Capability consistency, performance accuracy

### Context Aggregate
- Root: Context
- Includes: State, History, Checkpoints
- Invariants: State consistency, history immutability

### Team Aggregate
- Root: Team
- Includes: Members, Roles, Strategy
- Invariants: Role uniqueness, strategy validity

## Domain Events

### Task Events
- TaskCreated
- TaskDecomposed
- TaskAssigned
- TaskStarted
- TaskCompleted
- TaskFailed

### Agent Events

- AgentCapabilityAdded
- AgentStatusChanged
- AgentPerformanceUpdated

### Context Events
- ContextCreated
- ContextUpdated
- ContextCheckpointed

## Business Rules

1. **Task Assignment**: Tasks can only be assigned to agents with matching capabilities
2. **Context Inheritance**: Child contexts must inherit parent state
3. **Team Composition**: Teams must have at least one agent
4. **Performance Tracking**: All executions must record metrics
5. **Pattern Promotion**: Patterns with >90% success rate over 10 uses are promoted
6. **Agent Availability**: Agents can only be in one team at a time
7. **Context Consistency**: Context state must be consistent across checkpoints
8. **Capability Matching**: All task requirements must be satisfied by team capabilities
