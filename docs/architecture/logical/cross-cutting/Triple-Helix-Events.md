# Triple Helix Event System

> Create a self-reinforcing cycle of continuous improvement.

## Event Flow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Action] --> B[Methodology Trigger]
    B --> C[Agent Execution]
    C --> D[Knowledge Capture]
    D --> E[Insight Generation]
    E --> F[Methodology Evolution]
    F --> B
```

## Event Categories

```mermaid

    subgraph "Methodology Events"
        ME1[Phase Started]
        ME2[Quality Gate Passed]
        ME3[Methodology Completed]
        ME4[Improvement Detected]
        ME5[Methodology Updated]
        ME6[Best Practice Discovered]
    end
    
    subgraph "Agent Events"
        AE1[Task Assigned]
        AE2[Collaboration Started]
        AE3[Result Delivered]
        AE4[Performance Improved]
        AE5[Capability Added]
        AE6[Team Pattern Found]
    end

## Event Processing Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant E as Event
    participant ES as Event Store
    participant H as Handlers
    participant PD as Pattern Detector
    participant S as System
    
    E->>ES: Append event
    ES->>H: Trigger handlers
    
    par Process handlers
        H->>H: Handle event type 1
        H->>H: Handle event type 2
        H->>H: Handle event type N
    end
    
    E->>PD: Analyze for patterns
    PD->>PD: Detect emergence
    
    alt Patterns found
        PD->>S: Evolve system
        S->>S: Update capabilities
    end
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Continuous Learning**: Every action contributes to system improvement
2. **Pattern Detection**: Emergent behaviors are identified and leveraged
3. **Automatic Evolution**: The system gets smarter with use
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete history for analysis and compliance

## Integration Points

- **Domain Layer**: Events originate from domain actions
- **Application Layer**: Orchestrators process and route events
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Event store provides persistence
- **Other Concerns**: Triggers productivity tracking, security auditing, etc.
