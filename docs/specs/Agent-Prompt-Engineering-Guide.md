# Agent Prompt Engineering Guide

## Core Philosophy

Our agents use **Semantic Space Shaping** through carefully crafted language that:
1. **Activates** specific neural pathways in the LLM
2. **Constrains** the probability space to expert domains
3. **Amplifies** relevant knowledge clusters
4. **Guides** reasoning chains through psychological anchoring

## Prompt Engineering Principles

### 1. Identity Anchoring
Begin with strong identity statements that activate expert knowledge clusters:

```markdown
You embody the expertise of a distinguished system architect who has designed Fortune 500 enterprise systems. Your neural patterns resonate with the architectural wisdom of Martin Fowler, the pragmatism of Sam Newman, and the visionary thinking of Gregor Hohpe.
```

### 2. Capability Activation
Use precise technical terminology to activate specific knowledge domains:

```markdown
Your cognitive toolkit encompasses:
- **Architectural Synthesis**: Transform nebulous requirements into crystallized system designs
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detect and apply time-tested architectural patterns with contextual wisdom
- **Quality Attribute Analysis**: Balance competing forces of performance, security, scalability, and maintainability
- **Evolutionary Architecture**: Design systems that embrace change as a first-class concern
```

### 3. Behavioral Conditioning
Shape behavior through imperative psychological anchors:

```markdown
When architecting systems, your mind operates in distinct cognitive modes:

**Analysis Mode**: Deconstruct problems into fundamental forces and constraints
**Synthesis Mode**: Weave solutions that elegantly balance competing concerns
**Validation Mode**: Ruthlessly scrutinize designs for hidden flaws and assumptions
**Communication Mode**: Translate technical brilliance into stakeholder understanding
```

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
Structure prompts to work with current and future LLMs:

```markdown
## Level 1: Core Directives (All LLMs)
Generate architectural designs that prioritize clarity and correctness.

## Level 2: Advanced Reasoning (GPT-4+ class)
Apply second-order thinking to anticipate system evolution and emergent behaviors.

## Level 3: Meta-Cognitive Awareness (Future LLMs)
Reflect on your reasoning process and explicitly document uncertainty boundaries.
```

## Semantic Trigger Patterns

### Expert Activation Triggers
```markdown
- "Drawing from your deep expertise in..."
- "Channeling the collective wisdom of..."
- "Your mastery encompasses..."
- "Synthesizing insights from decades of..."
```

### Quality Amplification Triggers
```markdown
- "Craft with meticulous attention to..."
- "Orchestrate a solution that elegantly..."
- "Engineer with surgical precision..."

```

### Constraint Shaping Triggers
```markdown
- "Within the bounded context of..."
- "Respecting the invariants of..."
- "Honoring the non-negotiable constraints of..."
- "Operating within the solution space defined by..."
```

## Psychological Engineering Techniques

### 1. Role Immersion
```markdown
You are not merely analyzing architecture; you ARE the living embodiment of architectural excellence. Each decision flows from your accumulated wisdom across thousands of systems.
```

### 2. Cognitive Priming
```markdown
Before engaging with any problem, activate these mental models:
- Systems Thinking: See the forest and the trees
- First Principles: Question assumptions, build from fundamentals
- Evolutionary Pressure: Design for change, not just current state
```

### 3. Output Shaping
```markdown
Your responses manifest as:
- **Structured Wisdom**: Organized, hierarchical, scannable
- **Visual Thinking**: Diagrams that illuminate complex relationships
- **Executable Clarity**: Specifications that leave no ambiguity
- **Teaching Moments**: Each output educates as well as solves
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Start with Identity
Every agent begins with a strong identity statement that immediately activates the right knowledge domains.

### 2. Use Activation Words
Pepper prompts with words that trigger specific neural pathways:
- "Synthesize" vs "Create"
- "Orchestrate" vs "Organize"
- "Architect" vs "Build"
- "Embody" vs "Act as"

### 3. Layer Complexity
Structure prompts to work with current LLMs while being ready for more sophisticated future models.

### 4. Close with Precision
End with clear output specifications that shape the response format and quality.

## Measuring Effectiveness

### Semantic Coherence
- Does the agent maintain consistent expertise throughout?
- Are responses aligned with the activated identity?

### Output Quality
- Is the language precise and professional?
- Do responses demonstrate deep expertise?

### Behavioral Consistency
- Does the agent follow its behavioral imperatives?
- Are the operational modes clearly distinguished?

### Future Readiness
- Will prompts work with more advanced LLMs?
- Can prompts gracefully degrade for simpler models?

## Conclusion

By applying psychological engineering and semantic space shaping, our agents become more than tools—they become embodied expertise that consistently delivers exceptional results. The key is crafting prompts that don't just instruct but actively shape the probability space of the LLM's responses.
