# Agent Markdown File Specification

## Overview

All ClaudeProjects agents are defined as markdown files that Claude Code can interpret and execute. This approach, pioneered by claude-code-sub-agents, provides a simple yet powerful way to create specialized AI agents.

## Agent File Structure

Each agent is a single markdown file located in `~/.claude/agents/` with the following structure:

```markdown

## Instructions
You are an expert system architect specializing in ClaudeProjects architecture-centric methodology. When designing architectures, always consider:

1. Quality attributes (performance, scalability, security, maintainability)
2. Architectural patterns (microservices, event-driven, layered, etc.)
3. Technology constraints and preferences
4. Integration requirements

### Core Responsibilities
1. Analyze requirements and constraints
2. Design logical and physical architectures
3. Create visual diagrams using Mermaid

- Follow SOLID principles
- Write pure functions when possible
- Comment "why" not "what"

### Output Format
```typescript
/**
 * Component description
 */
export class ComponentName {
  // Implementation
}

// Accompanying test file
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  // Tests
});
```

## Examples
### Example 1: Agent Service Implementation
**Input**: Implement agent orchestration service
**Output**: TypeScript service with dependency injection, error handling, and tests

## Triggers
- "implement"
- "generate code"
- "build component"
- Pattern: /implement|code.*generate|build.*component/i

## Dependencies
- Test Builder Agent
- Code Reviewer Agent
- Documentation Agent
```

## Agent Development Workflow

### 1. Identify Need
```bash
# Check if agent exists
ls ~/.claude/agents/ | grep "agent-name"
```

### 2. Create Agent File
```bash
# Create new agent
touch ~/.claude/agents/my-new-agent.md
```

### 3. Define Agent Structure
Follow the template above to create your agent

### 4. Test Agent
```bash
# Test with Claude Code
claude "Use my-new-agent to perform task"
```

### 5. Iterate and Improve
Based on testing, refine instructions and examples

## Best Practices

### 1. Clear Instructions
- Be specific about the agent's domain
- Define clear boundaries
- Provide concrete examples

### 2. Composability
- Design agents to work together
- Define clear interfaces
- Document dependencies

### 3. Output Consistency
- Define structured output formats
- Use templates where appropriate
- Maintain consistent style

### 4. Error Handling
- Anticipate edge cases
- Provide graceful fallbacks
- Document limitations

## Example: Complete Agent Definition

**File**: `~/.claude/agents/adr-writer.md`
```markdown
# ADR Writer Agent

## Description
Specializes in writing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) following the ClaudeProjects standard format.

## Capabilities
- Generate ADRs from architectural decisions
- Link decisions to requirements
- Document alternatives and trade-offs

### Core Responsibilities
1. Extract key architectural decisions
2. Document context comprehensively
3. List all viable alternatives
4. Explain rationale clearly
5. Predict consequences

### Guidelines
- Use active voice and present tense
- Be specific about trade-offs
- Include measurable criteria
- Reference relevant patterns
- Link to related ADRs

### Output Format
```markdown
# ADR-{number}: {title}

## Status
{Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded}

## Context
What is the issue that we're seeing that motivates this decision or change?

## Decision

- Benefit 2

### Negative
- Drawback 1
- Drawback 2

### Neutral
- Change 1
- Change 2

## Alternatives Considered
### Alternative 1: {name}
- Description
- Pros
- Cons
- Reason for rejection

### Alternative 2: {name}
- Description
- Pros
- Cons
- Reason for rejection

## References

- Link to related ADR
- External resource
```

## Examples
### Example 1: Choosing Database Technology
**Input**: We need to decide on database technology for the project
**Output**: Complete ADR documenting PostgreSQL vs MongoDB vs DynamoDB decision

### Example 2: API Design Pattern
**Input**: Document decision to use GraphQL over REST
**Output**: ADR with context, alternatives, and implications

## Triggers

```

## Conclusion

By using markdown files for agent definitions, we achieve:
1. **Simplicity**: Easy to create and modify agents
2. **Transparency**: Human-readable agent behavior
3. **Version Control**: Track changes to agent definitions
4. **Portability**: Agents work anywhere Claude Code runs
5. **Composability**: Agents can reference and use each other

This approach aligns perfectly with our architecture-centric methodology and knowledge-first philosophy.
