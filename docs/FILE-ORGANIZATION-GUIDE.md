## Where to Put Files - Quick Reference

### 🏗️ Sprint 3 Implementation Files

**Agent Implementations**
```
/agents/
├── core/               # orchestrator, context, methodology, knowledge agents
├── domain/             # project, research, innovation, analytics agents
└── infrastructure/     # obsidian, sync, version, license agents
```

**Active Sprint Work**
```
/sprints/current/       # Current sprint working files
/sprints/planning/      # Sprint planning documents
```

**Runtime/Working Files**
```
/.claudeprojects/
├── messages/           # Message queue (auto-generated)
├── context/            # Context storage (auto-generated)
├── state/              # Agent states (auto-generated)
└── cache/              # Performance cache (auto-generated)
```

### 📚 Documentation

**Permanent Architecture Documentation**
```
/docs/architecture/
├── 01-product-vision/  # WHY - Vision documents (rarely changes)
├── 02-logical-architecture/  # WHAT - Conceptual design
├── 03-physical-architecture/ # HOW - Implementation design
└── ADRs/               # Architecture Decision Records
```
⚠️ **Only add to architecture/ if it's a permanent reference document**

**Integration Patterns & Guides**
```
/docs/integration-guides/   # Claude Code patterns, Obsidian integration
/docs/guides/               # User guides, tutorials
```

**Project Management**
```
/docs/project-management/   # Sprint plans, roadmaps, milestones
```

### 📦 Archives

**Sprint Artifacts** (After sprint completion)
```
/docs/archives/sprint-N/
├── daily-summaries/    # Daily progress updates
├── analysis/           # Research, gap analysis, requirements
├── presentation/       # Demo materials, slides
└── retrospective/      # Sprint retrospectives
```

## Decision Tree: Where Does This File Go?

1. **Is it executable code or an agent definition?**
   - YES → `/agents/` (appropriate subdirectory)
   - NO → Continue...

2. **Is it generated by the system at runtime?**
   - YES → `/.claudeprojects/` (appropriate subdirectory)
   - NO → Continue...

3. **Is it a permanent architecture/design document?**
   - YES → `/docs/architecture/` (appropriate section)
   - NO → Continue...

4. **Is it about how to integrate with external tools?**
   - YES → `/docs/integration-guides/`
   - NO → Continue...

5. **Is it project/sprint management related?**
   - YES → `/docs/project-management/`
   - NO → Continue...

6. **Is it current sprint work in progress?**
   - YES → `/sprints/current/`
   - NO → Continue...

7. **Is it from a completed sprint?**
   - YES → `/docs/archives/sprint-N/` (appropriate category)
   - NO → Ask the team!

## Examples

### ✅ Good File Placement

- `orchestrator-agent.md` → `/agents/core/`
- `sprint-3-standup-2025-01-28.md` → `/sprints/current/` (then archive later)
- `ADR-007-New-Pattern.md` → `/docs/architecture/ADRs/`
- `claude-code-webhook-integration.md` → `/docs/integration-guides/`
- `sprint-4-planning.md` → `/docs/project-management/`

### ❌ Bad File Placement

- `daily-notes.md` → `/docs/architecture/` (Should be in `/sprints/current/`)
- `test-analysis.md` → Root directory (Should be in appropriate subfolder)
- `old-design.md` → `/docs/architecture/` (Should be archived if superseded)

## Maintenance Rules

1. **During Sprint**: Keep working files in `/sprints/current/`
2. **End of Sprint**: Archive to `/docs/archives/sprint-N/`
3. **Permanent Docs**: Only proven, stable documentation in `/docs/architecture/`
4. **Clean as You Go**: Don't let temporary files accumulate

## Questions?

If unsure where a file belongs:
1. Check this guide
2. Look for similar existing files
3. Ask in the team chat
4. Default to `/sprints/current/` for work in progress

Remember: **A clean repository is a productive repository!**
