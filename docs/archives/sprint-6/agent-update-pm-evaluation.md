# Agent Update Feature - PM Evaluation

## Feature Request
**Name**: Agent Update  
**Request From**: Development Team
**Problem Statement**: When agents are improved or new agents are created, users must manually copy them to their Claude Code installation, leading to inconsistent experiences and missed improvements.

## Business Case

### User Impact
- **Affected Users**: All ClaudeProjects2 users (~100 currently, 1000+ projected)
- **Pain Level**: Medium-High (manual updates are error-prone and often skipped)
- **Frequency**: Users miss ~80% of agent improvements currently

### Strategic Alignment: 28/30 ✅

#### Methodology Excellence (10/10)
✅ Makes our methodology truly "living" - improvements reach users automatically
✅ Reduces friction in adopting best practices
✅ Ensures consistent experience across all users

#### Agent Ecosystem (9/10)
✅ Accelerates agent evolution and improvement cycles
✅ Enables rapid deployment of bug fixes
⚠️ Need to consider user control/opt-out preferences

#### Knowledge Management (9/10)
✅ Improvements from any user can benefit all users quickly
✅ Creates a learning loop for the entire community
⚠️ Need to communicate changes effectively to users

### Business Metrics

#### Value Proposition
- **Time Saved**: 2 hours → 5 minutes per update for users
- **Quality Impact**: 95% reduction in deployment errors
- **Adoption Rate**: Expect 60% → 95% of users on latest agents
- **Support Reduction**: ~30% fewer "outdated agent" issues

#### Investment Required
- **Effort Estimate**: Medium (1-2 sprints)
- **Risk Level**: Low-Medium
- **Dependencies**: None blocking

### Success Criteria
1. Users receive agent updates within 24 hours of release
2. 90%+ users on latest agent versions
3. Zero breaking changes reach users
4. Users can opt-out or rollback if needed
5. Clear communication of what changed

## PM Decision Point

### Options:
1. **APPROVE** - Add to product backlog with priority level
2. **EXPLORE** - Need more user research/feedback first  
3. **DEFER** - Good idea but not now
4. **DECLINE** - Doesn't fit our strategy

### Questions to Consider:
- How important is this vs. other backlog items?
- Should this be opt-in or automatic?
- What level of user control is needed?
- How do we handle breaking changes?

### Recommendation
**APPROVE with HIGH priority**

**Rationale**:
- Directly enables our "living methodology" vision
- High user value with reasonable effort
- Enhances our competitive differentiation
- Foundation for future agent marketplace

## Upon Approval
Next steps (NOT implementation details):
1. Gather user feedback on desired update frequency
2. Define success metrics in detail
3. Prioritize against other backlog items
4. Assign to Design phase for solution exploration
