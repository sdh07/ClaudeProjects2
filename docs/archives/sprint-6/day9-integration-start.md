# Sprint 5, Day 9: Integration & Demonstration Start

## Issue #45: Bringing It All Together

### Current State
We have successfully built all components of the Architecture Traceability and CPDM system:

1. **Vision Traceability** (Issue #41) ✅
   - vision-agent maintains product vision
   - Triple Helix validation operational
   - Real-time vision dashboard

2. **Logical Architecture** (Issue #42) ✅
   - logical-architect-agent manages Layer→Domain→Object
   - Clear ownership model eliminates fuzziness
   - Moderate boundary enforcement

3. **Physical Architecture** (Issue #43) ✅
   - physical-architect-agent maps objects to components
   - ADR automation with confirmation
   - Complete deployment specifications

4. **CPDM Implementation** (Issue #44) ✅
   - 7-phase methodology defined
   - quality-agent and trace-agent created
   - Workflow engine operational
   - Successfully demonstrated with Obsidian editor feature

## Day 9 Integration Plan

### 1. Connect All Traceability Points

#### Vision → Logical Connection
```bash
# Test vision to logical trace
vision-agent validate-feature "test-integration"
logical-architect-agent assign-to-layers "test-integration"
```

#### Logical → Physical Connection
```bash
# Test logical to physical trace
logical-architect-agent get-domain-objects "knowledge_domain"
physical-architect-agent map-to-components "KnowledgeBase"
```

#### Physical → Implementation Connection
```bash
# Test physical to implementation trace
physical-architect-agent get-component-spec "knowledge-agent"
# Verify implementation matches spec
```

### 2. Create Integration Test Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# integration-test.sh

echo "=== ClaudeProjects2 Traceability Integration Test ==="

# Start a feature through complete flow
FEATURE="integration-test-$(date +%s)"

# Phase 1: Vision
echo "1. Starting in Vision phase..."
./scripts/cpdm-workflow-engine.sh start "$FEATURE" "Test integration"

# Phase 2-7: Complete flow
for phase in design decision implementation quality delivery feedback; do
    echo "Transitioning to $phase..."
    ./scripts/cpdm-workflow-engine.sh transition "$FEATURE"
    sleep 1
done

# Verify traceability
echo "Verifying complete traceability..."
trace-agent verify-trace --feature="$FEATURE"

echo "Integration test complete!"
```

### 3. Build Traceability Dashboard

Create a real-time dashboard showing:
- Vision elements and their features
- Features and their layer distribution
- Layers and their domains
- Domains and their objects
- Objects and their components
- Components and their deployment status

### 4. Agent Orchestration Rules

Update CLAUDE.md with complete orchestration rules:
```yaml
orchestration:
  feature_request:
    1: vision-agent (validate)
    2: logical-architect-agent (design)
    3: physical-architect-agent (decide)
    4: development-team (implement)
    5: quality-agent (validate)
    6: deployment-team (deliver)
    7: trace-agent (feedback)
```

## Demo Scenario: "From Vision to Production in 10 Steps"

### Feature: "AI-Powered Code Review Assistant"

**Step 1: Vision Update**
- PM updates vision with "Code Quality Excellence"
- vision-agent detects new emphasis

**Step 2: Feature Identification**
- System identifies need for code review enhancement
- Triple Helix validation: 28/30 ✅

**Step 3: Logical Design**
- Assigned to quality_domain (70%), development_domain (30%)
- Domain objects created: CodeReview aggregate, Review entity

**Step 4: Physical Design**
- CodeReview → code-review-agent (complexity 9)
- Technology: Claude Code agent

**Step 5: ADR Documentation**
- ADR-021: AI Code Review Integration
- Confirmation requested and received

**Step 6: Implementation**
- code-review-agent created
- Integration with existing review process

**Step 7: Testing**
- Unit tests: 95% coverage
- Integration tests: All passing

**Step 8: Quality Gates**
- All mandatory gates: PASSED
- Performance: < 2s per review

**Step 9: Deployment**
- Agent deployed to production
- Monitoring activated

**Step 10: Feedback**
- Developer satisfaction: +30%
- Review quality: +45%
- Feeds back to vision

## Integration Checklist

### Connections to Validate
- [ ] Vision → Features
- [ ] Features → Layers
- [ ] Layers → Domains
- [ ] Domains → Objects
- [ ] Objects → Components
- [ ] Components → Technologies
- [ ] Technologies → ADRs
- [ ] ADRs → Deployments
- [ ] Deployments → Metrics
- [ ] Metrics → Vision (feedback loop)

### Automation to Verify
- [ ] CPDM workflow engine runs end-to-end
- [ ] Quality gates trigger automatically
- [ ] ADRs generate on significant decisions
- [ ] Trace verification runs continuously
- [ ] Feedback loops to vision

### Documentation to Complete
- [ ] CPDM user guide
- [ ] Traceability matrix template
- [ ] Agent training materials
- [ ] Architecture compliance checklist
