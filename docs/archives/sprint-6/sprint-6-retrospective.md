# Sprint 6 Retrospective & CPDM Improvements

## Sprint 6: CPDM Test Drive
**Duration**: 1 day (of 5 planned)
**Date**: 2025-08-06

## What Went Well âœ…

### From Claude's Perspective:
1. **Critical Discovery**: Found and fixed agent deployment issue
2. **Cross-platform Solution**: Implemented hybrid deployment (symlink/copy)
3. **Architecture Updates**: Physical architecture properly documented changes
4. **Quick Recovery**: Fixed issue in ~1 hour after discovery

### From PM's Perspective (YOUR INPUT NEEDED):
1. <!-- What worked well from your view? -->
2. <!-- What did you like about the CPDM process? -->
3. <!-- Any positive surprises? -->

## What Could Be Improved ðŸ”§

### From Claude's Perspective:
1. **Agent Testing Gap**: Never validated agents were actually deployed/usable
2. **Logical Architecture Gap**: Logical-architect-agent didn't persist documentation
3. **Knowledge Gap**: Incomplete understanding of Claude Code sub-agent architecture
4. **Process Confusion**: Initially tried to dictate implementation in Vision phase

### From PM's Perspective (YOUR INPUT NEEDED):
1. <!-- What frustrated you? -->
2. <!-- Where did CPDM fail or slow you down? -->
3. <!-- What was confusing or unclear? -->

## Key Learnings ðŸ“š

### Technical Learnings:
1. Agents must be in `.claude/agents/` to be recognized by Claude Code
2. YAML frontmatter format is critical (tools as comma-separated string)
3. Symlinks provide instant updates, copy requires re-deployment
4. Architecture agents need explicit instructions to update source docs

### Process Learnings (YOUR INPUT NEEDED):
1. <!-- What did you learn about CPDM? -->
2. <!-- What would you do differently? -->
3. <!-- Any insights about PM/Architect roles? -->

## CPDM Improvements Proposed ðŸš€

### Based on Sprint 6 Experience:

#### 1. Vision Phase Improvements
- **Current Issue**: PM role boundaries unclear
- **Proposed Fix**: 
  - Clear template: WHAT (capability) and WHY (value)
  - Explicit: "No HOW - that's for architects"
  - Examples of good vs bad vision statements

#### 2. Architecture Phase Improvements
- **Current Issue**: Architects may not validate deployment environment
- **Proposed Fix**:
  - Mandatory environment validation checklist
  - "Deploy and test" before design approval
  - Document deployment requirements in physical architecture

#### 3. Quality Gates
- **Current Issue**: Missing validation that agents actually work
- **Proposed Fix**:
  - Add "Deployment Verification" gate after Implementation
  - Require end-to-end test (not just unit tests)
  - Validate Tool invocation actually works

#### 4. Agent Improvements
- **Current Issue**: Agents don't consistently update architecture docs
- **Proposed Fix**:
  - Explicit "update source documentation" in agent prompts
  - Separate report generation from documentation updates
  - Add verification step for documentation updates

### PM's Proposed Improvements (YOUR INPUT):
1. <!-- What would make CPDM better for you? -->  I am puzzled if I should start with planning a sprint to plan features ending in issues that we than work on, or if a just start with features from which a sprint plan with issues is produced... should features be defined as an issue in github? Yet I have not worked with the PM but an sub agent that drives my through the process and explains a bit would be nice.  
2. <!-- Any new gates or checks needed? --> this sprint still felt like that I need to check everything to make sure that artefacts are generated according our architecture, e.g. I needed to tell that to look for how sub agants are functioning in claude code. I hope this will get better once we really use our agents. Another example: our sprint folder current is filling up and is not taken care of, I assume that would be also an agent task... Never forget me or other users in your Retros. Wjat about feed back from the sub agents?!
3. <!-- Process simplifications? -->
4. <!-- Better PM/Architect collaboration? --> User guidance (see above: where are we, what comes next)

## Sprint 7 Planning Preview

### Feature: Agent Excellence
**YOUR VISION NEEDED**:
- What does "Agent Excellence" mean to you?
  
  Agents should be designed and updated regulary according to:
  - User Feedback and real A-B tests
  - Method fit
  - latest insights for Claude Code Sub Agents
  - latest insights from context engineering / prompt engineering for frontier LLMs
  - using the latest and appropriate MCP tools
  
- What problems should it solve?
	- ineffective agents producing wrong results (halluzination)
	- inefficient agents producing right results with too many tokens or simply not good results because the power of the LLMs are not triggered correctly
- What value should it deliver?
	- effective and efficient agents
- Success criteria?
	- 100% effective agents
	- 95% efficient agents
	- improvements by A/B test measured on quality of results and consumed tokens (quwlity more important)

### Suggested Focus Areas (You Choose):
- [x] Agent quality metrics and monitoring
- [x] Agent self-improvement capabilities
- [x] Agent testing framework
- [x] Agent performance optimization
- [x] Agent documentation standards
- [ ] Other: think about my points above, like "Regular Agent Engineering Lab"

## Action Items

### Immediate (Sprint 6 Closure):
