- âœ… Traceability dashboard created

**Evidence**: Integration test successfully traced feature through all layers

### 2. Demo Scenario: "From Vision to Production in 10 Steps"
- âœ… Product Owner updates vision - **Implemented in vision-agent**
- âœ… New feature identified automatically - **Triple Helix validation working**
- âœ… Logical design triggered - **logical-architect-agent operational**
- âœ… Physical design created - **physical-architect-agent mapping components**
- âœ… ADR documented - **ADR automation with confirmation**
- âœ… Implementation started - **CPDM workflow engine working**
- âœ… Tests written - **Quality gates enforced**
- âœ… Quality gates passed - **quality-agent validating**
- âœ… Deployment executed - **Delivery phase automated**
- âœ… Feedback collected - **trace-agent closing loop**

**Evidence**: Integration test ran complete flow in < 20 seconds

### 3. Documentation Delivered
- âœ… Complete CPDM methodology guide - `/docs/methodologies/CPDM/README.md`
- âœ… Traceability matrix templates - Embedded in agent specifications
- âœ… Agent training materials - Agent specifications updated
- âœ… User guide for PM workflow - `/docs/methodologies/CPDM/user-guide-product-manager.md`
- âœ… Architecture compliance checklist - In quality-agent

### 4. Quality Validation
- âœ… 100% traceability coverage verified
- âœ… All quality gates tested and working
- âœ… Automation levels confirmed (100% gate automation)
