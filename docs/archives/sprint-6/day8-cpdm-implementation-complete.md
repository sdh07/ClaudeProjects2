## Integration Points Established

### 1. Agent Communication
- quality-agent â†” all phase owners
- trace-agent â†” all agents
- vision-agent â†’ trace-agent (feedback loop)

### 2. Message Queues
```
/.claudeprojects/messages/
â”œâ”€â”€ quality/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input/    # Gate check requests
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ output/   # Gate check results
â”œâ”€â”€ trace/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input/    # Phase notifications
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ output/   # Traceability reports
```

### 3. State Management
```
/.claudeprojects/state/
â”œâ”€â”€ cpdm-workflow.json   # Active features and phases
â”œâ”€â”€ quality-agent.json   # Gate history and metrics
â””â”€â”€ trace-agent.json     # Traceability matrix
```

## Quality Gates Framework

### Enforcement Levels
1. **Mandatory** ðŸ”´ - Cannot proceed without passing
2. **Recommended** ðŸŸ¡ - Should pass, can override with justification
3. **Optional** ðŸŸ¢ - Nice to have, logged for improvement

### Gate Examples by Phase

| Phase Transition | Mandatory Gates | Recommended Gates |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Vision â†’ Design | Triple Helix, ROI > 10x, PM approval | Market analysis |
| Design â†’ Decision | Domain complete, boundaries clear | Performance defined |
| Decision â†’ Implementation | ADRs confirmed, tech approved | Deployment plan |
| Implementation â†’ Quality | Code reviewed, unit tests pass | Coverage > 80% |
| Quality â†’ Delivery | Integration tests, security clean | Load tests |
| Delivery â†’ Feedback | Deployment success, monitoring | User acceptance |

---

## Key Achievements

### 1. Full Automation
- âœ… Automated gate checking at every phase
- âœ… Automatic trace verification
- âœ… Metrics collection without manual intervention

### 2. Complete Traceability
- âœ… Vision â†’ Feature â†’ Layer â†’ Domain â†’ Object â†’ Component â†’ Deployment
- âœ… Bidirectional tracing supported
- âœ… Automatic orphan detection

### 3. Quality Built-In
- âœ… Gates prevent quality issues from propagating
- âœ… Early detection of problems
- âœ… Clear remediation paths

### 4. Feedback Loop
- âœ… Continuous improvement cycle
- âœ… Vision updates based on usage
- âœ… Data-driven decision making
