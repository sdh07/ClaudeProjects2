- Implemented file-based message queue with atomic operations
- Built agent loader with YAML frontmatter parsing
- Created templates for agents and CLAUDE.md

### Core Agents (Issue #29) âœ…
Implemented ahead of schedule:
- **orchestrator-agent**: Routes requests based on CLAUDE.md rules
- **project-agent**: Manages sprints and agile workflows
- **context-agent**: Fast context switching with caching

3. **Workflow Demonstration**
   - Created `demo-workflow.sh` showing agent coordination
   - Demonstrates Sprint 4 planning workflow
   - Shows real message passing between agents

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. Implement knowledge-agent for capturing insights
2. Implement methodology-agent for agile ceremonies
3. Create more complex integration scenarios
4. Begin self-hosting ClaudeProjects2 development

## ðŸ’¡ Insights

- File-based approach working well for MVP
- Agent coordination via messages is clean and testable
- YAML frontmatter provides good metadata structure
- Shell scripts enable rapid prototyping

## ðŸŽ‰ Celebration
