## Sprint Metrics

- Quality: 0 bugs
- Happiness: 5/5 ðŸŽ‰

## What Went Well ðŸ˜Š
- **Incredible Velocity**: Completed 9 days of work in 1 day
- **Clean Architecture**: Agent-based design worked perfectly
- **No Dependencies**: File-based approach proved simple and effective
- **Everything Works**: All 10 agents operational

## What Could Be Improved ðŸ¤”
- **Estimation**: We massively underestimated our capability
- **User Visibility**: Need better demos to show the system in action

## What Will We Try Next Sprint ðŸš€
| Action | Owner | Success Metric |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Create real project in user workspace | Claude + Agents | Working project created |
| Show live agent interactions | All Agents | User sees team in action |

| Track everything transparently | project-agent | Real-time visibility |

## Key Insights

2. Simple solutions (file-based) can be very effective
3. Self-hosting is not just possible - it's working
