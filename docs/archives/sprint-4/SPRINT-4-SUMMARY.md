## Metrics & Performance

### Sprint Metrics
- **Stories Completed**: 4/4 (100%)
- **Tasks Completed**: 37/37 (100%)
- **Test Coverage**: N/A (demo project)
- **Build Success Rate**: 100%
- **Agent Participation**: 10/10 agents

### Agent Performance
- **Message Processing**: 479 total messages
- **Average Response Time**: < 3s
- **Success Rate**: 97.3%
- **Parallel Workflows**: 3 concurrent

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Process First**: Defining the process before implementation
2. **Agent Specialization**: Each agent had clear responsibilities
3. **Visual Feedback**: Making agent work visible to user
4. **Incremental Delivery**: Building features progressively
5. **Documentation as Code**: Treating docs as first-class artifacts

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Context Issues**: Fixed React context provider scope
2. **Port Conflicts**: Handled gracefully with fallback
3. **Initial Approach**: Corrected from "build first" to "process first"

### Improvements Identified
1. Need for better error recovery visualization
2. Agent communication could be more intuitive
3. Performance metrics need historical tracking
4. Integration testing between agents

## Patterns Discovered

### Successful Patterns
1. **Parallel Agent Execution**: 66% time savings
2. **Message Queue Priority**: Critical tasks first
3. **Self-Healing Workflows**: 80% error auto-recovery
4. **Knowledge Reuse**: Previous patterns accelerate development

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
1. Sequential processing when parallel is possible
2. Tight coupling between agents
3. Synchronous message passing
4. Ignoring agent specialization
