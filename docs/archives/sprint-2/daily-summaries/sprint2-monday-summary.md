# Sprint 2 Monday Summary: Product Vision Deep Dive & Gap Analysis

**Date**: 2025-08-05
**Issue**: #22
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Completed Deliverables

1. **Vision Analysis Document** (`vision-analysis.md`)
   - Extracted 10 key architectural requirement categories
   - Identified measurement approaches for 10x productivity
   - Analyzed Triple Helix implementation needs
   - Listed specific agent types and capabilities

2. **Requirements Extraction Spreadsheet** (`requirements-extraction.csv`)
   - 52 specific requirements identified
   - Categorized by: Performance, Methodology, Agents, Knowledge, Integration, UX, Architecture, Business Model, Security
   - Priority levels assigned (Critical/High/Medium)
   - Complexity estimates provided

3. **Gap Analysis Report** (`gap-analysis-report.md`)
   - Strong alignments: Triple Helix, methodology-driven, agent ecosystem, living knowledge, local-first
   - Critical gaps: Claude Code integration, Obsidian integration, specific agent definitions, ROI measurement
   - Risk assessment with mitigation strategies
   - Specific recommendations for Tuesday-Friday

4. **Stakeholder Questions** (`stakeholder-questions.md`)
   - 17 question categories organized by priority
   - Critical questions for Tuesday/Wednesday decisions
   - Clear response format requested
   - Decision points identified

## Key Findings

### Vision Strengths
- Clear value proposition (10x productivity)
- Strong differentiation (executable methodologies)
- Compelling user stories (Bernhard case study)
- Well-defined business model

### Critical Gaps Identified
1. **Claude Code Integration**: No specific integration design despite being primary AI engine
2. **Obsidian Integration**: No defined sync architecture for knowledge platform
3. **Agent Specialization**: Generic framework without specific agent implementations
4. **Performance Engineering**: No concrete approach to achieve < 500ms context switching
5. **Business Model Enforcement**: No technical mechanism for tier differentiation

### Architecture Risks
- **High Risk**: Integration patterns undefined (Claude Code + Obsidian)
- **Medium Risk**: Knowledge graph implementation, business model enforcement
- **Low Risk**: UI/UX implementation, basic functionality

## Recommendations for Tuesday

1. **Morning Focus**: Deep dive into claude-code-sub-agents repository
   - Study CLAUDE.md patterns
   - Analyze agent-organizer approach
   - Understand context management

2. **Afternoon Focus**: Obsidian integration research
   - Plugin architecture capabilities
   - Vault synchronization options
   - Knowledge graph possibilities

3. **Key Decisions Needed**:
   - Claude Code integration depth (markdown agents vs abstraction)
   - Obsidian integration method (plugin vs file system vs API)
   - Agent communication protocol

## Status Update for Issue #22

All Monday deliverables have been completed:
- ✅ Read all product vision documents thoroughly
- ✅ Extract key architectural requirements
- ✅ Map vision to logical architecture alignment
- ✅ Document gaps and questions
- ✅ Research comparable products/architectures
- ✅ Create vision analysis document
- ✅ Create requirements extraction spreadsheet
- ✅ Create gap analysis report
- ✅ Compile questions for stakeholder

## Next Steps

Tuesday's logical architecture analysis and Claude Code research will focus on:
1. Resolving critical integration gaps
2. Defining agent architecture patterns
3. Establishing performance engineering approach
4. Preparing for Wednesday's physical architecture design

The gap analysis has revealed that while the vision is strong and the logical architecture provides good structure, the critical integration points (Claude Code + Obsidian) need immediate attention to ensure the physical architecture can deliver the promised 10x productivity gains.
