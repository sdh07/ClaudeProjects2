## Success Criteria

### Must Have (MVP)
- [ ] Can create notes in Obsidian from Claude Code
- [ ] Can read Obsidian notes in Claude Code
- [ ] Basic agent can access Obsidian knowledge
- [ ] Changes sync bidirectionally
- [ ] No data loss during sync

### Should Have

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Obsidian API Complexity
**Mitigation**: Start with simple file operations, iterate

### Risk: MCP Protocol Issues
**Mitigation**: Build minimal implementation first

### Risk: Sync Conflicts
**Mitigation**: Simple last-write-wins initially
