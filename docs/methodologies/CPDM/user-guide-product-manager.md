## Quick Start

As a Product Manager, you drive the vision and approve key decisions. CPDM automates the technical flow while keeping you in control at critical points.

### Your Primary Responsibilities
1. **Maintain the Product Vision** - Keep it current and aligned with business goals
2. **Approve Features** - Validate that new features align with vision
3. **Confirm ADRs** - Approve significant architectural decisions
4. **Review Feedback** - Use metrics and user feedback to refine vision

### GitHub Integration Advantage
CPDM is **fully integrated with GitHub**, meaning:
- Every feature creates a GitHub issue automatically
- You can track progress in GitHub Projects
- All decisions are recorded in Git history
- Team collaboration happens in PR reviews
- No need to learn new tools - it's all in GitHub!

### Your First Day with CPDM

```bash
# 1. Check your active features
./scripts/cpdm-workflow-engine.sh status

# 2. View the vision dashboard
cat docs/architecture/01-product-vision/vision-dashboard.md

# 3. Start a new feature
./scripts/cpdm-workflow-engine.sh start "feature-name" "description"
```

## Your Role in Each Phase

### Phase 1: Vision ‚≠ê **You Own This**
**Your Actions:**
- Update vision when market/strategy changes
- Review feature proposals
- Approve/reject based on alignment
- Set priorities

**What Happens Automatically:**
- Triple Helix validation (Methodology + Agents + Knowledge)
- ROI calculation
- Business impact assessment

**Your Decision Gate:**
```
‚ùì Does this feature align with our vision?
‚ùì Is the ROI acceptable (target > 10x)?
‚ùì What priority should this have?

‚úÖ APPROVE ‚Üí Proceeds to Design
‚ùå REJECT ‚Üí Feature archived with reason
```

### Phase 2: Design üëÄ **You Monitor**
**What's Happening:**
- Logical architecture being designed
- Domains and layers assigned
- Interfaces defined

**Your Involvement:**
- Review design summaries (optional)
- No approval needed unless flagged

**Notification Example:**
```
üìß "Feature 'user-auth' design complete:
   - 60% Presentation Layer
   - 25% Domain Layer
   - Assigned to security_domain
   No issues detected."
```

### Phase 3: Decision ‚≠ê **You Approve ADRs**
**Your Actions:**
- Review and confirm Architecture Decision Records
- Especially for new technologies or major changes

**Decision Request Example:**
```
üîî ADR Confirmation Required: "OAuth2 Integration"

Context: User authentication needs enterprise SSO
Decision: Implement OAuth2 with Azure AD
Impact: New dependency, 2-week implementation
Cost: $500/month for Azure AD

[ CONFIRM ] [ MODIFY ] [ REJECT ] [ DEFER ]
```

- Blockers (if any)
- Estimated completion

### Phase 5: Quality üö¶ **You're Notified of Issues**
**Automatic Checks:**
- All tests passing
- Performance metrics met
- Security scans clean

**You're Alerted If:**
- Quality gates fail
- Override needed for production

### Phase 6: Delivery ‚úÖ **You Approve Production**
**Your Final Check:**
```
üöÄ Ready for Production: "user-auth"
- All quality gates: PASSED
- Tests: 98% coverage
- Performance: Meets SLA
- Rollback plan: Ready

[ DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION ] [ DEPLOY TO STAGING ] [ HOLD ]
```

### Phase 7: Feedback üìä **You Review & Act**
**Your Actions:**
- Review user feedback summaries
- Analyze usage metrics
- Update vision based on learnings
- Prioritize improvements

**Weekly Report Example:**
```
üìä Feature Performance: "user-auth"
- Adoption: 87% of users

./scripts/cpdm-workflow-engine.sh start "your-feature" "description"
```

**"Feature is stuck in a phase"**
```bash
# Diagnose the issue
quality-agent diagnose-gate --feature="stuck-feature"

vision-agent update-priority "feature-name" "critical"

# System automatically re-orders backlog
```

**"ROI calculation seems wrong"**
