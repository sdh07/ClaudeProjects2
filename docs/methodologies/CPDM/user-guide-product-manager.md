## Quick Start

As a Product Manager, you drive the vision and approve key decisions. CPDM automates the technical flow while keeping you in control at critical points.

### Your Primary Responsibilities
1. **Maintain the Product Vision** - Keep it current and aligned with business goals
2. **Approve Features** - Validate that new features align with vision
3. **Confirm ADRs** - Approve significant architectural decisions
4. **Review Feedback** - Use metrics and user feedback to refine vision

### GitHub Integration Advantage
CPDM is **fully integrated with GitHub**, meaning:
- Every feature creates a GitHub issue automatically
- You can track progress in GitHub Projects
- All decisions are recorded in Git history
- Team collaboration happens in PR reviews
- No need to learn new tools - it's all in GitHub!

### Your First Day with CPDM

```bash
# 1. Check new feature requests from community
gh issue list --label "needs-triage" --label "feature-request"

# 2. Check your active features
./scripts/cpdm-workflow-engine.sh status

# 3. View the vision dashboard (or ask pm-guide-agent)
cat docs/architecture/01-product-vision/vision-dashboard.md
# OR: Use Task tool with pm-guide-agent "Show me today's dashboard"

# 4. Start a new feature (from approved request)
./scripts/cpdm-workflow-engine.sh start "feature-name" "description"
```

---

## Feature Request Management

### NEW: Community-Driven Features

Features now flow from community/team requests through GitHub:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Community] -->|Creates Issue| B[Feature Request]
    B -->|You Review| C[Triage]
    C -->|Approve| D[Sprint Planning]
    C -->|Backlog| E[Future]
    C -->|Reject| F[Won't Fix]
```

### Weekly Feature Review Process

```bash
# Every Monday morning:
# 1. View pending requests
gh issue list --label "needs-triage" --label "feature-request"

# 2. For each request, evaluate
./scripts/cpdm-workflow-engine.sh evaluate-feature [issue-number]

# 3. Apply decision labels
gh issue edit [number] --add-label "approved,priority-2-important"
# OR
gh issue close [number] --comment "Not aligned with vision"
```

### Priority Labels
- `priority-1-critical`: Next sprint
- `priority-2-important`: Within 2 sprints
- `priority-3-nice`: When possible
- `priority-4-later`: Future consideration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"I don't see my feature in the dashboard"**
```bash
# Check if it was started correctly
./scripts/cpdm-workflow-engine.sh status | grep "your-feature"

# If not found, start it
./scripts/cpdm-workflow-engine.sh start "your-feature" "description"
```

**"Feature is stuck in a phase"**
```bash
# Diagnose the issue
quality-agent diagnose-gate --feature="stuck-feature"

# See blockers
./scripts/cpdm-workflow-engine.sh status "stuck-feature"

# Override if business critical
./scripts/cpdm-workflow-engine.sh override "stuck-feature" "reason" "PM"
```

**"I need to change priority"**
```bash
# Update in vision
vision-agent update-priority "feature-name" "critical"

# System automatically re-orders backlog
```

**"ROI calculation seems wrong"**
```bash
# Get detailed calculation
vision-agent show-roi-details "feature-name"

# Update if needed
vision-agent recalculate-roi "feature-name" --cost=X --benefit=Y
```

"pm-guide-agent: Explain this CPDM phase"
```

### NEW: sprint-cleanup-agent
Automatically manages sprint artifacts:
