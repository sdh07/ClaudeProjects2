# Sprint 9 Day 7: Dynamic Optimization - Complete âœ…

## Day 7 Achievements

### 1. Dynamic Optimizer Implementation
**Created: `dynamic-optimizer.sh`**

Core capabilities:
- **Real-time monitoring** of agent operations
- **Team adjustment** when agents are overloaded
- **Load balancing** across available agents
- **Resource prediction** based on historical patterns
- **Adaptive strategies** based on system load
- **Optimization recommendations** for running tasks

### 2. Optimizer Database Schema
**Created: `.cpdm/intelligence/optimizer.db`**

Tables:
- `agent_availability` - Real-time agent status tracking
- `team_adjustments` - History of dynamic team changes
- `resource_predictions` - Forecasted resource needs
- `adaptive_strategies` - Condition-based execution strategies
- `load_distribution` - Load balance history

### 3. Real-Time Team Adjustment

#### Overload Detection
```bash
./scripts/dynamic-optimizer.sh monitor
```
Tracks agent status:
- ðŸŸ¢ Idle (0 tasks)
- ðŸŸ¡ Busy (1-2 tasks)
- ðŸ”´ Overloaded (3+ tasks)

#### Automatic Adjustment
```bash
./scripts/dynamic-optimizer.sh adjust <context> <team>
```
- Detects overloaded agents
- Finds idle replacements
- Records adjustments
- Returns optimized team

### 4. Load Balancing System

#### Load Distribution
```bash
./scripts/dynamic-optimizer.sh balance
```
Analyzes:
- System utilization percentage
- Agent load distribution
- Imbalance detection
- Redistribution recommendations

#### Metrics
- Tracks load/capacity ratio
- Calculates balance scores
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Suggests specific redistributions

### 5. Predictive Resource Allocation

#### Resource Prediction
```bash
./scripts/dynamic-optimizer.sh predict [hours]
```
Features:
- Analyzes historical patterns by hour
- Predicts task load
- Calculates agents needed
- Recommends specific agents
- Tracks prediction accuracy

#### Example Output
```
Predicted load: 5 tasks
Agents needed: 2
Recommended:
  â€¢ code-review-agent
  â€¢ test-agent
```

### 6. Adaptive Strategy Engine

#### Strategy Selection
```bash
./scripts/dynamic-optimizer.sh strategy <context> <type>
```

Strategies:
- **High Load (>80%)**: Sequential execution, extended timeouts
- **Low Load (<30%)**: Parallel execution, aggressive retry
- **Balanced (30-80%)**: Standard execution parameters

Returns JSON configuration:
```json
{"parallel": true, "timeout": 5000, "retry": 3}
```

### 7. Running Task Optimization

#### Optimize Command
```bash
./scripts/dynamic-optimizer.sh optimize
```
Identifies:
- Slow-running tasks (>3s)
- Parallelization opportunities
- Available helper agents
- Specific recommendations

### 8. Continuous Monitoring

#### Watch Mode
```bash
./scripts/dynamic-optimizer.sh watch
```
- Real-time dashboard
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
- Shows current operations
- Updates agent availability
