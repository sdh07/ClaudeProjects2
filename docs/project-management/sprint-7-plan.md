# Sprint 7: Agent Excellence MVP

## Sprint Overview
- **Sprint Number**: 7
- **Sprint Name**: Agent Excellence
- **Duration**: 2 weeks (as approved by PM)
- **Start Date**: 2025-08-06
- **End Date**: 2025-08-20

2. Implement SubAgentMasterDesigner core functionality
3. Create technology-triggered learning mechanism
4. Implement context learning from failures
5. Deploy agent improvement metrics dashboard
6. Validate with real-world agent scenarios
