## Technical Architecture

    D --> E[Team Optimizer]
    E --> F[Team Deployment]
    F --> G[Result Aggregation]
    G --> H[Learning System]
```

### Team Composition Algorithm
```python
def compose_team(task):
    # Analyze task requirements
    requirements = analyze_task(task)
    
    # Match capabilities to requirements
    candidates = match_capabilities(requirements)
    
    # Optimize team composition
    team = optimize_team(candidates, requirements)
    
    # Assign roles and coordination
    team = assign_roles(team, task)
    
    return team
```

### Collaboration Patterns

#### Pipeline Pattern
```
Agent A -> Agent B -> Agent C -> Result
```

#### Parallel Pattern
```
       -> Agent A ->
Task ->  Agent B  -> Aggregator -> Result
       -> Agent C ->
```

#### Hierarchical Pattern
```
Lead Agent
    ├── Sub-Agent A
    ├── Sub-Agent B
    └── Sub-Agent C
```

## Implementation Tasks

### Core Components
1. **Task Analyzer**
   - Complexity scoring
   - Domain detection
   - Requirement extraction

2. **Capability Matcher**
   - Skill matching
   - Tool requirement checking
   - Performance history

3. **Team Optimizer**
   - Cost minimization
   - Performance maximization
   - Resource balancing

4. **Learning System**
   - Pattern recognition
   - Success tracking
   - Recommendation engine

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Task decomposition accuracy > 90%
- [ ] Team composition time < 500ms
- [ ] Successful task completion > 95%
- [ ] Agent utilization > 80%
- [ ] Learning improvement > 10% week-over-week

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Over-complex team compositions
  - **Mitigation**: Simplicity bias in optimizer
- **Risk**: Poor task decomposition
  - **Mitigation**: Fallback to manual decomposition
- **Risk**: Agent conflicts
  - **Mitigation**: Clear role boundaries, conflict resolution

## Dependencies
