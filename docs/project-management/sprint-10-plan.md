## Technical Implementation

### Performance Tracking Architecture

    A[Agent] --> B[Performance Hook]
    B --> C[Metrics Collector]
    C --> D[SQLite DB]
    D --> E[Analytics Engine]
    E --> F[Dashboard]
    E --> G[Alerts]
```

### Circuit Breaker States
```
CLOSED -> OPEN (on failure threshold)
OPEN -> HALF_OPEN (after timeout)
HALF_OPEN -> CLOSED (on success)
HALF_OPEN -> OPEN (on failure)
```

### Recovery Strategy Matrix
| Error Type | Primary Strategy | Fallback Strategy |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Timeout | Retry with backoff | Alternative agent |
| Capability Missing | Find equivalent agent | Decompose task |
| Agent Failure | Circuit breaker | Manual escalation |
| Context Loss | Restore from checkpoint | Rebuild context |
| Performance Degradation | Scale resources | Reduce scope |

### Learning System Flow
```python
def learn_from_execution(task, team, result):
    # Record execution
    record = create_execution_record(task, team, result)
    
    # Extract patterns
    patterns = extract_patterns(record)
    
    # Update pattern database
    update_patterns(patterns, result.success)
    
    # Generate recommendations
    recommendations = generate_recommendations(patterns)
    
    # Promote successful patterns
    if result.success and pattern.count > 10:
        promote_to_default(pattern)
    
    return recommendations
```

## Implementation Components

### Performance Metrics
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Success rate
- Error rate by type
- Resource utilization
- Queue depth
- Context size
- Team composition efficiency

### Recovery Patterns
1. **Retry Pattern**
   - Max attempts: 3
   - Backoff: exponential (1s, 2s, 4s)
   - Jitter: Â±10%

2. **Circuit Breaker**
   - Failure threshold: 5 in 1 minute
   - Open duration: 30 seconds
   - Half-open test: 1 request

3. **Bulkhead Pattern**
   - Isolate critical agents
   - Resource pools per domain
   - Prevent cascade failures

### Dashboard Features
- Real-time agent status
- Performance trends
- Error heat map
- Team composition history
- Pattern effectiveness
- Cost analysis
- Predictive alerts

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Performance tracking < 50ms overhead
- [ ] Error recovery success > 80%
- [ ] Pattern recognition accuracy > 85%
- [ ] Dashboard refresh < 1 second
- [ ] Learning improvement > 15% monthly
- [ ] Alert accuracy > 90%

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Performance overhead
  - **Mitigation**: Async metrics, sampling
- **Risk**: Complex recovery logic
  - **Mitigation**: Simple fallbacks, clear escalation
- **Risk**: Learning system drift
  - **Mitigation**: Human review, bounded changes
