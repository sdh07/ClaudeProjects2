## Issue 4: Claude Projects Development Method (CPDM)

### Day 7-8: CPDM Concept Development

#### 4a) Concept: End-to-End Development Method
**Objective**: Define CPDM from ADRs to deployment

**Core Phases**:
1. **Vision Phase**: Product vision to features
2. **Design Phase**: Features to architecture
3. **Decision Phase**: Architecture to ADRs
4. **Implementation Phase**: ADRs to code
5. **Quality Phase**: Code to tested artifacts
6. **Delivery Phase**: Artifacts to production
7. **Feedback Phase**: Production to vision

**Per-Phase Deliverables**:
- Entry/exit criteria
- Required artifacts
- Quality gates
- Agent responsibilities
- Automation opportunities

#### 4b) Implementation: CPDM Toolchain
**Objective**: Implement CPDM in ClaudeProjects2

**Deliverables**:
- CPDM workflow engine
- Phase transition automation
- Quality gate enforcement
- Traceability dashboard
- Agent orchestration rules

**Key Agents**:
- `methodology-agent`: CPDM guardian
- `project-agent`: Phase tracking
- `quality-agent`: Gate enforcement (new)
- `trace-agent`: Traceability tracking (new)
