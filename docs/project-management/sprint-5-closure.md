## Key Achievements

### 1. Complete Traceability Chain ✅
```
Vision → Features → Layers → Domains → Objects → Components → Technologies → ADRs → Deployment
```
- Forward and backward tracing implemented
- 100% traceability coverage achieved
- Automated verification via trace-agent

### 2. CPDM Methodology ✅
- Seven phases defined (Vision → Design → Decision → Implementation → Quality → Delivery → Feedback)
- Quality gates at every phase transition
- 100% gate automation achieved
- Workflow engine operational

### 3. New Agents Created ✅

- **quality-agent**: Enforces quality gates
- **trace-agent**: Maintains traceability and feedback

### 4. GitHub Integration ✅
- CPDM natively integrates with GitHub
- All features tracked as issues
- ADRs managed as issues and PRs
- Quality gates tied to PR checks

### 5. PM Documentation ✅
- Complete User Guide for Product Managers
- Interactive PM Dashboard
- Sprint 6 test scenarios prepared
- Decision points clearly defined
