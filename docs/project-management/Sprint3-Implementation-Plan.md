# Sprint 3: Delivery Readiness for Claude Code Projects
**Goal**: Use ClaudeProjects2 to manage ClaudeProjects2 development

## Sprint 3 Milestone

**Achieve delivery readiness for Claude Code projects** by implementing:
- Core agents needed for software delivery
- Project management capabilities
- Agile methodology support
- Self-hosting ClaudeProjects2 development

## Why This Is Achievable

1. **Focused Scope**: Only agents needed for software delivery
2. **Clear Use Case**: Managing our own development
3. **Immediate Validation**: We use it as we build it
4. **Natural Progression**: Builds on Sprint 2 architecture

- [ ] Generate sprint report

## Minimum Viable Agents

### 1. orchestrator-agent
```markdown
---
name: orchestrator-agent
description: Routes requests to appropriate agents
---

You orchestrate ClaudeProjects2 agent ecosystem.
Route software development tasks to specialized agents.
```

### 2. project-agent
```markdown
---
name: project-agent  
description: Manages sprints, tasks, and milestones
---

You manage agile software projects.
Track sprints, create issues, monitor progress.
```

### 3. code-review-agent
```markdown
---
name: code-review-agent
description: Reviews code changes and PRs
---

You review code for quality, patterns, and standards.
Provide constructive feedback on pull requests.
```

## Success Metrics

### Delivery Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Can create and manage sprints
- [ ] Can track GitHub issues
- [ ] Can review pull requests
- [ ] Can capture architectural decisions
- [ ] Can generate progress reports
- [ ] Can run daily standups

### Validation: Sprint 4 Planning
On Day 10, we'll use ClaudeProjects2 to:
1. Create Sprint 4 backlog
2. Assign tasks to agents
3. Set up issue tracking
4. Generate planning documents
5. Commit everything via version-agent

## CLAUDE.md for ClaudeProjects2

```markdown
# ClaudeProjects2 - Self-Hosted Development

You are orchestrating the development of ClaudeProjects2 itself.

## Current State
- Sprint: 3
- Goal: Delivery readiness for Claude Code projects
- Phase: Implementation
- Methodology: Agile/Scrum

## Active Agents
- orchestrator-agent (routing)
- project-agent (sprint management)
- code-review-agent (PR reviews)
- version-agent (git operations)

## Orchestration Rules
1. Sprint planning → project-agent
2. Code reviews → code-review-agent
3. Git operations → version-agent
4. Architecture decisions → knowledge-agent
5. Daily standups → project-agent with standup template

## Current Sprint
- Number: 3
- Days: 1-10
- Focus: Core agents for delivery
- Progress: Day 0
```

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Circular dependency | High | Start with manual operations, automate gradually |
| Agent complexity | Medium | Keep agents simple, enhance iteratively |
| Integration issues | Medium | Test each agent in isolation first |
| Scope creep | High | Focus only on delivery needs |

## Daily Plan

### Day 1: Foundation
- Morning: Repository structure
- Afternoon: Message queue implementation
- Goal: Messages passing between files

### Day 2: First Agent
- Morning: Agent loader
- Afternoon: orchestrator-agent
- Goal: Route a simple request

### Day 3: Project Management
- Morning: project-agent basics
- Afternoon: Sprint/task tracking
- Goal: Create Sprint 4 skeleton

### Day 4: Version Control
- Morning: version-agent
- Afternoon: Git integration
- Goal: Commit via agent

### Day 5: Integration
- Morning: Connect all agents
- Afternoon: First workflow
- Goal: Complete development cycle

### Days 6-9: Enhancement
- Add remaining delivery agents
- Integrate with GitHub
- Add knowledge capture
- Polish workflows

### Day 10: Self-Hosting
- Morning: Migrate to self
- Afternoon: Sprint 4 planning
- Goal: Fully self-hosted

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Immediate Value**: Useful from Day 3
2. **Real Validation**: Actually using the system
3. **Clear Focus**: Only what's needed for delivery
4. **Fast Feedback**: Daily usage reveals issues
5. **Team Alignment**: Everyone uses same system

## Next Steps After Sprint 3

With delivery readiness achieved:
- **Sprint 4**: Add innovation methodologies
- **Sprint 5**: Sales methodologies
- **Sprint 6**: Advanced features
- **Sprint 7**: Community release

This positions ClaudeProjects2 as a real, working system by end of Sprint 3!
