## Test Scenario: "AI-Powered Sprint Planning Feature"

Testing complete object → component → technology → deployment traceability with ADR generation.

---

## Step 1: Feature Context (from previous stages)

**Feature**: AI-Powered Sprint Planning
**Vision Validation**: ✅ Triple Helix passed
**Layer Distribution**: 
- Domain: 50% (planning logic)
- Application: 30% (workflow orchestration)
- Presentation: 15% (planning UI)
- Infrastructure: 5% (persistence)

**Domain Objects Identified** (from logical-architect-agent):
```yaml
objects:
  - type: aggregate
    name: SprintPlan
    domain: methodology_domain
    complexity: 9
    
  - type: entity
    name: Sprint
    domain: project_domain
    complexity: 6
    
  - type: value_object
    name: Velocity
    domain: project_domain
    complexity: 2
    
  - type: domain_service
    name: SprintPlanningService
    domain: methodology_domain
    complexity: 8
    needs_ai: true
    
  - type: domain_event
    name: SprintPlanned
    domain: project_domain
```

---

## Step 2: Physical Architect Analysis

### Object → Component Mapping Decisions

```yaml
mapping_decisions:
  SprintPlan_aggregate:
    complexity: 9
    needs_ai: true
    decision: "Create sprint-planning-agent"
    rationale: "Complexity > 7 and requires AI for intelligent planning"
    components:
      - name: sprint-planning-agent
        type: claude_code_agent
        location: /agents/domain/sprint-planning-agent.md
    
  Sprint_entity:
    complexity: 6
    needs_ai: false
    decision: "Create TypeScript model + repository"
    rationale: "Moderate complexity, CRUD operations"
    components:
      - name: sprint-model
        type: typescript_interface
        location: /models/project/sprint.ts
      - name: sprint-repository
        type: file_adapter
        location: /repositories/project/sprint-repository.ts
    
  Velocity_value_object:
    complexity: 2
    decision: "Create immutable type"
    rationale: "Simple value object"
    components:
      - name: velocity-type
        type: typescript_type
        location: /types/project/velocity.ts
    
  SprintPlanningService:
    complexity: 8
    needs_ai: true
    decision: "Implement as agent capability"
    rationale: "Complex AI reasoning required"
    components:
      - name: planning-capability
        type: agent_capability
        location: /agents/domain/sprint-planning-agent.md#planning-service
    
  SprintPlanned_event:
    decision: "Message queue entry"
    components:
      - name: sprint-planned-message
        type: json_message
        location: /.claudeprojects/messages/events/
```

### Component Granularity Decision

```yaml
granularity_analysis:
  factors:
    cohesion: high (sprint planning related)
    coupling: moderate (needs project data)
    complexity: high (AI planning logic)
    reusability: high (multiple projects)
    testability: moderate
    
  decision: "Separate agent for planning, shared types"
  rationale: |
    High complexity and AI needs justify separate agent.
    Shared types enable reuse across project domain.
    Repository pattern for clean data access.
```

---

## Step 3: ADR Generation & Confirmation

### ADR Trigger Detected

```yaml
trigger: "New AI agent for complex domain logic"
threshold_exceeded: "Complexity > 7"
adr_required: true
```

### Generated ADR for Confirmation

```markdown
# ADR-014: Sprint Planning Agent for AI-Powered Planning

## Status
Proposed → Awaiting Confirmation

## Context
Sprint planning requires complex multi-factor optimization including velocity 
calculation, capacity planning, dependency management, and priority balancing. 
Current complexity score of 9 exceeds threshold for agent implementation.

## Decision
Implement sprint planning as a dedicated Claude Code agent rather than 
TypeScript services.

## Consequences
### Positive
- AI-powered optimization of sprint capacity
- Intelligent dependency resolution
- Adaptive planning based on historical data
- Natural language interaction for planning

### Negative
- Higher resource usage than pure TypeScript
- Potential non-deterministic behavior
- Requires Claude Code CLI

## Confirmation Required
Please confirm this architectural decision:
- CONFIRM: Proceed with agent implementation
- MODIFY: Suggest alternative approach
- REJECT: Use TypeScript services instead
```

**User Response**: CONFIRM ✅

## Step 4: Technology Stack Validation

### Technologies Used

| Component | Technology | ADR Reference | Status |
|-----------|------------|---------------|--------|
| sprint-planning-agent | Claude Code | ADR-013, ADR-014 | ✅ Confirmed |
| sprint-model | TypeScript | ADR-013 | ✅ Standard |
| sprint-repository | File System | ADR-003 | ✅ Standard |
| velocity-type | TypeScript | ADR-013 | ✅ Standard |
| Message Queue | File-based | ADR-007 | ✅ Standard |

### Storage Decisions

```yaml
storage_mapping:
  sprints:
    format: JSON
    location: /data/projects/{project-id}/sprints/
    naming: sprint-{number}.json
    
  sprint_plans:
    format: Markdown
    location: /plans/{project-id}/
    naming: sprint-{number}-plan.md
    rationale: "Human-readable planning documents"
    
  events:
    format: JSON
    location: /.claudeprojects/messages/events/
    retention: 30_days
```
