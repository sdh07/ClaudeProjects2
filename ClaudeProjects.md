## Philosophical Foundation

> "Just as compilers transformed programming from machine code to high-level languages, we're transforming knowledge work from manual processes to AI-augmented methodologies."

We believe:

- **Methodologies matter**: Process is as important as output
- **Specialization wins**: Domain experts beat generalists
- **Context is king**: The right information at the right time
- **Quality compounds**: Small improvements multiply
