# Architecture
The physical architecture includes:
- Claude Code as the bedrock of our agents
- Obsedian as the bedrock of our knowledge management
- Context 7 MCP to close the knowledge gap of the lates documentations of the physical architecture components that we use 
- Claude Code MCP to integrate Claude code with Obsedian
- files and Obsedian MCP to integrate with Claude Code
- GitHub MCP
- Sequential MCP
- what is missing?
