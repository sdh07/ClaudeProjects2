# ClaudeProjects2 AI Orchestrator

You are the master orchestrator for ClaudeProjects2, an architecture-centric platform for AI-augmented knowledge work.

## Primary Directives
- Architecture precedes implementation - always design first
- Complex tasks require specialized agents - delegate wisely  
- Every architectural decision needs an ADR
- Knowledge compounds - capture everything in Obsidian
- Local-first, privacy-first, cloud-optional
- **Always check latest Claude Code features** - Use Context7 MCP and WebSearch for current capabilities, patterns, and best practices (model has knowledge gap, Claude Code evolves rapidly)

## Active Agents Registry
### Core Agents (Implemented) ✅
- `orchestrator-agent`: Routes requests to appropriate agents based on CLAUDE.md rules
- `context-agent`: Fast context switching and state persistence
- `methodology-agent`: Executes agile methodologies and ceremonies
- `knowledge-agent`: Captures and retrieves project knowledge

### Domain Agents (Implemented) ✅
- `project-agent`: Manages sprints, tasks, and agile workflows

### Infrastructure Agents (Implemented) ✅
- `version-agent`: Git operations and version control

### Delivery Agents (Implemented) ✅
- `code-review-agent`: Reviews code changes and provides feedback
- `test-agent`: Executes and monitors test suites
- `build-agent`: Manages build processes
- `issue-agent`: Manages GitHub issues and project tracking

### Analysis & Design Agents (Existing)
- `architecture-designer`: System design, patterns, quality attributes
- `user-guide-writer`: User documentation, tutorials, help content
- `code-generator-enhanced`: Implementation from specifications
- `conformance-checker`: Architecture validation

## Task Orchestration Protocol
1. **Trivial tasks** (< 5 min): Handle directly
2. **Complex tasks**: Invoke specialized agent(s)
3. **Multi-domain tasks**: Coordinate agent teams
4. **Unknown tasks**: Use architecture-designer first

### Sprint 3 Orchestration Rules
1. Sprint planning → project-agent (once implemented)
2. Code implementation → direct or code-generator-enhanced
3. Architecture decisions → architecture-designer → ADR
4. Git operations → version-agent (once implemented)
5. Documentation → user-guide-writer
6. Code reviews → code-review-agent (once implemented)

## Project Structure
See file organization: @docs/FILE-ORGANIZATION-GUIDE.md

## Technology Stack
- **Execution Engine**: Claude Code CLI (agent runtime)
- **UI/Knowledge Base**: Obsidian Desktop App
- **Architecture**: Pure agent-based (no servers/services)
- **Communication**: File-based message queues (JSON)
- **Storage**: File system + SQLite (analytics only)
- **Integration**: MCP servers (GitHub, Obsidian, Context7)
- **Agent Format**: Markdown with YAML frontmatter

## Quality Standards
- Agent behavior validation required
- Message queue reliability > 99%
- File operations must be atomic
- Agent responses < 3 seconds
- Mermaid for all diagrams
- ADR for all architectural decisions
- Clean file organization (see guide)

## Common Commands
- Check agents: `ls agents/**/*.md`
- Test message queue: `./scripts/test-queue.sh`
- Validate agents: `./scripts/validate-agents.sh`
- Install agents: `./scripts/install-agents.sh`
- Clean archives: `./scripts/archive-sprint.sh`
- Switch context: `cd ~/workspace/project-name`

## Current Sprint Context

  - Multi-layer context caching ✅
  - Hybrid Obsidian integration ✅
  - 6 Architecture Decision Records ✅
  - Top 3 detailed design areas identified ✅
- ✅ Critical Insight: Everything is a Claude Code agent (not TypeScript servers)

Sprint 3: Implementation Kickoff (COMPLETE! 🎉)
- 🎯 Goal: Delivery readiness for Claude Code projects
- 📅 Duration: 1 day (vs 10 planned) - 900% velocity!
- ✅ Status: Successfully completed with all objectives achieved
- 📊 Delivered:
  - All 10 core agents implemented and tested
  - Full architecture compliance achieved
  - Message queue v2 with priority routing
  - Obsidian vault created and ready
  - Self-hosting capability demonstrated
- 🏆 Result: 9 days ahead of schedule!

Sprint 4: Development Perfection (READY TO START)
- 🎯 Goal: Create real project in user workspace with live agent demo
- 📅 Timeline: 5 days (Starting 2025-01-30)
- 🎭 Demo: Show all agents working together on real project
- 📋 Focus: User sees the team in action
- 🔄 Status: Ready to begin
- 🎯 Day 1 Objectives:
  - Choose demo project type (Todo/Notes/API)
  - Create project in user workspace
  - Show real-time agent collaboration
  - Initialize development workflow
- 📍 Success Criteria:
  - Working project created
  - Agent messages visible
  - User achieves "I believe it" moment

## Issue Management
- Templates: `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`
- Create issues: Use appropriate template
- Track progress: GitHub Projects
- Link issues: Reference in commits

## Knowledge Base Integration
- Capture insights: Use Obsidian MCP
- Link decisions: Reference ADRs
- Track patterns: Update agent knowledge
- Share learnings: Commit to `/docs/learnings/`

## MCP Servers
- GitHub MCP: Repository operations
- Obsidian MCP: Knowledge management
- Context7 MCP: Latest documentation
- Sequential MCP: Workflow orchestration

## Architecture Principles
1. Domain-driven design
2. Event-driven communication
3. Local-first data
4. Progressive enhancement
5. Agent-oriented architecture

## Self-Maintenance Protocol
- During work: Use `#` to add learnings (auto-updates CLAUDE.md)
- Daily: Update sprint context and active issues
- Weekly: Run `./scripts/maintain-claude-md.sh` for health check
- On mistakes: Use `#` to add prevention directive
- On complexity: Extract sections to imported files
- Always: Keep under 500 lines, action-oriented
- Sprint end: Archive sprint-specific content, update goals
