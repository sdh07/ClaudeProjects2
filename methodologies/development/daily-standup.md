# Daily Standup Template

**Purpose**: Synchronize the team, identify blockers, and plan the day's work

## Standup Rules
- Maximum 15 minutes
- Same time, same place daily
- Standing up (if in person)
- Focus on commitment to team
- Not a status report to manager

## Format Options

### Classic Three Questions
Each team member answers:
1. What did I complete yesterday?
2. What will I work on today?
3. What blockers do I have?

### Walk the Board
Review each work item on the board:
- Who's working on it?
- What's the status?
- Any blockers?
- Expected completion?

### Improvement Focus
1. Yesterday's achievements
2. Today's plan
3. How can the team help me?
4. How can I help the team?
